Alternatively, take a [[glider]] to [[Digsite]]. Use a [[rope]] on the rift, and then climb down into the rift. There are several \"rooms\" which you need to get through to complete the quest. It's recommended to have food and [[Antipoison]], but you can leave to get food or supplies at any time during the quest. However, you will have to '''start over''' in the room that you were in when you left. \n\n'''<span style=\"color:red\">WARNING:</span>''' If you die in the rift, you '''will lose your items'''.\n\n===Rage===\n{{Cquote2|''\"Why should I, Tolna, be trapped in such a wretched place?

Only one weapon can be taken at a time.\n\nThere are four types of monster in this room and each is killed with a specific weapon. The correct weapon will deal normal damage multiplied by 10. The right combinations are as follows:\n[[File:A Soul's Bane - maximum outrage.gif|thumb|220px|The player, outraged, kills all the remaining monsters.]]\n[[File:A Soul's Bane - Tolna leaves home.png|thumb|220px|Tolna leaves the streets of Varrock in search of a more lucrative life.]]\n*[[Anger sword]] - kills [[Angry unicorn]]\n*[[Anger spear]] - kills [[Angry bear]]\n*[[Anger mace]] - kills [[Angry giant rat]]\n*[[Anger battleaxe]] - kills [[Angry goblin]]\n\nPlayers can do large amounts of damage on these creatures, but no experience is gained. Each creature killed raises the \"rage level\" bar at the top of the screen. After several kills of the player's choice of angry creatures, the bar will reach maximum and the player will yell, swirl, and kill all remaining monsters in the room.\n\nA cutscene will then play, in which Tolna leaves his mother for a more lucrative life, and players can then exit out of the rage room near the east end of the cave and go into the next room.\n\n===Fear===\n{{Cquote2|''\"It's so quiet and dark. I FEAR I may never escape this horrid place. Mum, Dad, help me!''}}\n\n''This room represents [[Tolna]]'s fear by giving players a frightening jolt when the player doesn't know whether or not a [[Fear reaper]] will attack.''\n\nIn this room, you have to search the dark holes. In some of them, you will find [[Fear reaper]]s. There will be a small jumpscare when you search the hole. You have to kill around five or six before your character will state that they are no longer afraid, and you may proceed to the next room.\n[[File:A Soul's Bane - dark holes.png|thumb|220px|You must look into the dark holes. Prepare for a small shock.]]\n'''Note that you can't keep searching the same hole over and over again.''' You will need to move around the room looking into each hole in sequence and starting over once they have all been looked-into. Depending on your luck, it will take approximately 4 or 5 round trips to complete 5 to 6 kills.\n\nYou will see a cutscene after the last kill. After that, you can enter the black hole (shouldn't be so black anymore) to the west.\n\n===Confusion===\n{{Cquote2|''Where am I, How long have I been here? Am I still the person I once was?

''\n\n[[File:A Soul's Bane - confusion beasts.png|thumb|220px|If you're doing 0 damage, then the creature is an illusion.]]\nIn this room, you have to kill [[Confusion beast]]s. Only one of them is real at the time\u2014others are illusions, and you will not inflict any damage on these (but you will get [[Combat]] XP), they will just disappear after you hit zeroes on them eight times. You can keep attacking the beasts until you find the real one, which you will actually damage and kill, or disengage by running to the opposite corner, then attacking another one.\n\nOnce you kill the real one, one of the confusing doors will vanish, and the rest of the beasts will respawn. Repeat this process until only one door remains.\n\n'''Note:''' [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] is best for this step, as the beasts won't move, and will use a ranged attack. When using [[Melee]], they will also use a melee attack that has a chance to [[poison]] (Use your '''Throwing knives''' if you brought them because they make for speedy kills on the illusions).\n\n'''Additional note:''' There may be an issue with the quest\u2014if you don't see any monsters when you enter the room, just log out and log back in.\n\n===Hopelessness===\n{{Cquote2|''What's the point?

They need to be killed three times each to make them die. Be careful of eating as 75% of the monster's health will be restored. Moreover, if they are poisoned, the poison effect is lost when they reach their next phase. Once you've killed them all, the Bridge of Hope will appear. After crossing the bridge, go through the exit, and you'll see a short cutscene.\n\n===Tolna===\n[[File:A Soul's Bane - Brana confronts Tolan.png|thumb|220px|Tolna's father, Brana, confronts his son.]]\n[[Tolna]], a three-headed beast, is in the final room. Beware, as this is a [[multicombat]] zone, so all three heads will attack you at once. They use a ranged attack from a distance and will very rapidly melee when up close. They are not very strong, but they attack quickly and will [[poison]] you, so bring [[Antipoison]] and a decent amount of food. Kill each head, and Tolna will become human again. The three heads are very easy to beat if you use [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]. \n\nTalk to Tolna, and he will take you back to the surface. Talk to him again and he will reward you.\n\n'''Congratulations!

After starting, talk to [[Hild]] in the nearby house north-east of [[Unferth]]. She will enchant your catspeak amulet if you give her five [[death runes]]. You can now open it to find [[Bob (cat)|Bob]]'s location. It works somewhat like a compass - when facing north, click the left or right whiskers to control the interface and point it in the right direction. When you see the central cat's eyes light up, go in that direction to find Bob. He can be anywhere in ''[[RuneScape]]''. '''However it is recommended to pick a common spot where Bob is found, and then world hop.''' He is commonly found at the Varrock anvils (south of the Varrock west bank, not the armour shop anvils).\n\n'''List of locations:'''\n[[File:Catspeak amulet in action.png|thumb|The interface of the Amulet of catspeak (e).

He will tell you that he's in love with [[Neite]], but she has no idea what his origins are so she's not interested in him. Talk to [[Gertrude]] (located south of the Cooking Guild, West of Varrock) about Bob's family. While there, your cat will tell you to research a warrior called [[Robert the Strong]].\n\nIn the [[Varrock Palace]] library, talk to [[Reldo]]. He will tell you that Robert the Strong was much taller and stronger than any other man of his time. His longbow was six feet tall, and he fought immortal monsters known as the [[Dragonkin]]. He fought alongside a black panther.\n\nReturn to Bob ('''who might have changed location, use the enchanted Catspeak amulet to locate him'''). You and your [[cat]] will try to convince Bob he is Robert the Strong. Your cat will remind you of how the [[Sphinx]] knows how you were hypnotised, so perhaps it can hypnotise Bob.\n\n===Hidden memories===\n'''''Recommended: '''a games necklace (if skipping cutscene)''[[File:Talking to sphinx.png|thumb|The Sphinx talking to Bob the cat in the desert.]]\nTalk to the [[Sphinx]] in [[Sophanem]]. A good way of getting there is to take a magic carpet to Pollnivneach from Shantay Pass and then to Sophanem using Pollnivneach's southern carpet - the Sphinx is south-east of the northern [[Pyramid Plunder|pyramid]]. Ask her for help, and after a bit, you'll have the option to view a five-minute cutscene or get a brief summary of what happens. '''''If you choose the brief summary, you won't be offered the option of being teleported to [[Burthorpe]].'''''\n\nDuring the cutscene, the Sphinx will teleport [[Bob (cat)|Bob]] to Sophanem and hypnotise him. Bob, thinking back on his earliest memories, recalls himself as [[Robert the Strong]]. He sees himself looking over at a tower beside [[Odysseus]], followed by a battle between them and a [[Dragonkin (A Tail of Two Cats)|dragonkin]]; the dragonkin manages to slay the panther and weaken Robert, but is killed by an immensely powerful attack by him.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\">\nBob The Cat Hypnotized.gif|Bob the Cat hypnotized by the Sphinx\nDragonkins castle.png|The Dragonkin on top of its castle.\nRobert the Strong fights.png|Odysseus fighting the Dragonkin, before being killed.\nRobert vs the Dragonkin.png|Robert continues to fight the Dragonkin after Odysseus dies.\nDragonkin dies.png |Robert finally kills the Dragonkin\n</gallery>\n\nAfter the cutscene, the Sphinx teleports [[Neite]] to Bob, who will be impressed and fall in love with him. Bob will tell you to keep his owner busy by doing his chores, and you will be given the option to teleport back to Burthorpe, or stay in Sophanem.\n\n===Bob's list===\n'''''Items required: '''A''' '''vial of water, white robe top and bottom (e.g. desert clothing), logs, a tinderbox, a bucket of milk, a chocolate cake, shears, a rake, a seed dibber, 4 potato seeds''\n\n'''''Recommended items: '''Varrock teleports, a games necklace''\n\nGo back to [[Unferth]]'s house in [[Burthorpe]] and do these [[chores]]:\n[[File:Cutting hair.png|thumb|One of the chores Bob asks you to do while he is gone.]]\n*Tidy house: Make Unferth's bed. This takes one click and is the easiest chore.\n*Warm human: Use some [[logs]] on the fireplace and light it.\n*Feed human: Use a [[bucket of milk]] and a [[chocolate cake]] on the table. '''Right click your cake! Do not eat it. A slice of cake does not work.'''\n*Tidy human: Use a pair of [[shears]] on Unferth to shave his hair. '''Note: The animation takes a couple of seconds, do not click away until he is bald.'''\n*Tend garden: Weed Unferth's patch in the yard just north of the house and plant four [[potato seed]]s. You now need to wait about 25 \u2013 35 minutes for them to grow. ''If this is the only remaining chore, you will be alerted by your character or your cat/kitten saying all the chores are finished.''\n\nAfter you've done all of this, talk to Unferth again. He'll tell you that he's very ill and must see a doctor or a nurse. Talk to the [[Apothecary]] in [[Varrock]] (located in the south-west of the city). He will tell you that Unferth is a [[Wikipedia:hypochondria|hypochondriac]] - he thinks that he's sick all the time even though he really has been tested for illnesses and it's all in his head. You need to use a placebo on him - pick a doctor's hat or nurse's hat from the Apothecary, and wear some white robes (princess robes and graceful outfit don't work).\n\nGo back to Unferth's house, and give him a [[vial of water]]. His illness will clear up. '''Note:''' You can't be wielding a weapon/shield; otherwise, Unferth won't believe you.\n\n===Love-cats===\nUsing your [[catspeak amulet]], find [[Bob (cat)|Bob]] again and talk to him. He may have moved to another of the other locations mentioned above, or even in the same location as before. You'll see a cutscene showing all the adventures Bob takes [[Neite]] on, including a [[magic carpet]] ride in [[Sophanem]], a conversation between Bob and the [[King Black Dragon]] (a player spoof known as [[R4ng3rNo0b889]] also tries to attack the dragon, but the dragon kills him instantly), and a journey on the [[Fishing Trawler]] ship.\n\n'''''Warning:''' If at any time during the cutscene, you try to interact with the surroundings (i.e. trying to pick up the bones of the dead ranger), you will be sent back to Burthorpe and you'll have to find Bob again and start the cutscene over.''\n\nAfter the cutscene, talk to [[Unferth]] to get a [[present]] from Bob.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\">\nBob and Neite in Sophanem.png|Bob and Neite in Sophanem\nBob talking to KBD.png|Bob talking to the King Black Dragon\nR4ng3rNo0b889 dying.png|R4ng3rno0b889 is killed by the King Black Dragon.\nTitanic reference.png|Bob and Neite sailing.\n</gallery>\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = A Tail of Two Cats\n|image = [[File:A Tail of Two Cats reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*2,500 [[experience]] in 2 [[skills]] of your choice over 30, or 5000 experience in one skill.\n*A Doctor or nurse's hat (you can switch by destroying your hat and requesting a new one from the Apothecary)\n*A [[Mouse toy]] (functions as a fun weapon at the [[Duel Arena]])\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\n*[[Dragon Slayer II]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*Upon telling [[Juna]] a story about this quest, you will say \"...And Bob and Neite were very happy together... at least for a while,\" and Juna will respond with \"The loss of a friend is never easy. However, you should always remember to be thankful of the time you had together.\" This is a reference to Bob's death at the end of the [[Dragon Slayer II]] quest, and can only be unlocked after it is completed. This dialogue is unique in that Dragon Slayer II is the only quest that Juna has two lines of dialogue for, and this is her only quote that pertains to two quests that are independent of each other.\n*The name of the quest \"A Tail of Two Cats\" is a reference to the Charles Dickens novel, \"{{wp|A Tale of Two Cities}}\".\n*When you first speak to Bob he says \"Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind. And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.\" It is spoken by Helena to Lysander in Shakespeare's \"{{wp|A Midsummer's Night Dream}}.\"\n*One of the scenes in the second cutscene shows a spoof scene of the film [[Wikipedia:Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]], Bob is standing on the bow of the ship and says: \"I'm king of Runescape\".\n*You can find a recipe for the [[chocolate cake]] if you search the bookcase while doing the chores in [[Unferth|Unferth's]] house.\n*During the cutscene with the Sphinx, Bob says \"Hey, I'm just this cat, you know.\" This is likely a reference to the character Gag Halfrunt in Douglas Adams' {{wp|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy}}. Additionally, during the initial dialogue with Unferth, the player comments how strange it is that Bob usually returns every Thursday before lunchtime; Adams' lead character, Arthur Dent, \"never could quite get the hang of Thursdays,\" and the series begins on a Thursday before lunchtime.\n*Upon examining the potato plants in Unferth's house, it says \"You say Potato,I say Poh-tar-to\".

He will ask if you are interested in hearing the tale of [[Serafina]]. He will briefly describe the connection between Serafina and the Theatre of Blood to you. During the conversation, you will see [[Vanstrom Klause]] and [[Ranis Drakan]] entering the Theatre, remarking that [[Safalaan]] and the [[Myreque]] should be informed.\n[[File:doh-mine+lab.png|thumb|200px|right|Path to the base.

He sends you to speak to some of [[King Roald]]'s [[Mercenary (Theatre of Blood)|mercenaries]] at the south-east corner of Ver Sinhaza.

[[Battle gear]] for shorter trip back to hideout.''\n[[File:A Taste of Hope - route to Serafina's home.png|thumb|250px|The route to Serafina's home from the mines or the Myreque Hideout.]]\n[[Safalaan]] plans to have his team meet up with [[Veliaf Hurtz]]'s in [[Burgh de Rott]] and escape [[Morytania]] in order to build up their numbers, as Morytania may not be safe anymore for them to hide in. You will ask him about [[Serafina]], and he will tell you [[Old Man Ral]] used to tell stories about her and will reveal to you where she used to live.\n\nUpon exiting the [[Myreque Hideout|hideout]], climb up the stairs, jump the gap and then climb down the ladder. From there, head due north through the three doors in a line, then due west until you reach the wall. From there, head north-west to reach a broken fountain. Climb down the stairs in the building directly south to meet up with Safalaan once more (''Optional: Search the bed by the stairs to obtain an [[old diary]]''). He will express his frustration with the tale of Serafina, as he believes it gives the citizens of Morytania a sense of false hope. He will then tell you the locked door in the room may contain what they are seeking.\n[[File:A Taste of Hope - Serafina's home.png|thumb|250px|The player and Safalaan in Serafina's home.]]\nSearch the crates and the barrels for a [[mysterious meat]], [[mysterious herb]], a [[vial]] and a [[pestle and mortar]]. Once you have these items, use the vial on the broken fountain north of the house to get a vial of water. Add the herb to create an [[Unfinished potion (A Taste of Hope)|unfinished potion]], then crush the meat with the pestle and mortar and use it on the unfinished potion. Use the finished [[Potion (A Taste of Hope)|potion]] on the door, but nothing will happen. Talk to Safalaan again with an empty vial, and he will give you a [[Vial of blood (A Taste of Hope)|vial of blood]]. Use another herb on the vial to create an [[unfinished blood potion]], then add the mysterious crushed meat to complete the [[blood potion]]. Use this on the door to unlock it. Take the [[Old notes (A Taste of Hope)|old notes]] from the chest, then give them to Safalaan.\n\n===It's a trap!===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[weapon]] and some [[food]] to fight a level 149 monster.''\n[[File:A Taste of Hope - Safalaan unleashes hidden power.gif|thumb|180px|Safalaan unleashes a hidden power, heavily weakening the abomination.]]\nHead back to the [[Myreque Hideout|hideout]], and speak to [[Safalaan]]. As you are all about to leave the hideout, [[Flaygian]] will tell you that the notes were complete nonsense. Safalaan will realise that he has been tricked by [[Vanstrom]] into giving up his blood at Serafina's house and prompts everyone to leave at once. However, it is too late, and the [[abomination]] reaches the base. It will kill [[Mekritus A'hara]], [[Andiess Juip]] and [[Flaygian Screwte]]. As it is about to attack Safalaan, he will levitate and emit a strange, cyan glow, which is amplified before producing a large explosion of power, weakening the abomination. [[Vertida]] will help you defeat the creature, but keep in mind his damage output is low.\n[[File:A Taste of Hope - fighting Abomination.png|thumb|left|250px|The player and Vertida fight the weakened abomination.]]\nThe abomination uses [[melee]] and [[ranged]] attacks; thus, the [[Protect from Missiles]] prayer should be used to avoid taking any damage. Additionally, the monster will occasionally launch a black sludge attack, which will drain the player's stats, so bringing at least one [[super restore potion]] is recommended. It is weakest to [[magic]] attacks, while having a high resistance to ranged attacks; therefore, a player with less than 70 Ranged should prepare to use magic accordingly. The fight is relatively easy.\n\n'''<span style=\"color:red\">Warning:</span>''' '''If you die during this encounter, any unprotected tradeable equipment dropped on death will be permanently lost!'''\n\n===The legendary weapon===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Rod of ivandis]], [[emerald]], [[chisel]], 3 [[air rune]]s and 1 [[cosmic rune]] \u2014 [[Battle gear]] recommended!''\n[[File:A Taste of Hope - old Myreque base.png|thumb|250px|The old Myreque base.]]\nOnce the fight is over, [[Safalaan]] and [[Vertida]] will ask you to meet at their old base, a small room underneath [[Old Man Ral]]'s house accessible via a trapdoor in the north room. Old Man Ral's house is easily accessed by taking the boat from [[Burgh de Rott]], going over the wall and running north-east. Once there, talk to Safalaan, who will insist on leaving. Vertida will then interject, telling him that [[Flaygian]] had managed to translate more of the book while you and Safalaan were investigating Serafina's home.\n\nSpeak to Vertida, who will give you [[Flaygian's notes]]. Read them, and discover that a weapon that may be effective against the [[Vyrewatch]] is a flail of some kind, with the [[rod of Ivandis]] being suitable as the flail's shaft. Search the nearby crates to find a [[silver sickle (b)]] and a [[chain]]. The rod of Ivandis can be obtained from [[Veliaf Hurtz]] in Burgh de Rott (under the pub), or can be made by the player again should they choose to do so.\n\n#Attach the emerald to the sickle to create an [[emerald sickle (b)]].\n#Then, cast [[Lvl-2 Enchant]] on the emerald sickle, or use an [[enchant emerald or jade]] [[tablet]] on it.\n#Finally, use the chain on the [[Enchanted emerald sickle (b)|enchanted emerald sickle]] or the Rod of Ivandis to create the [[Ivandis flail]].\n\nWhen you have the flail, speak with Safalaan, who will have [[Kael]] tell you that the vampyres believe that the [[Myreque]] has been completely defeated by the [[abomination]], and [[Ranis Drakan]] intends to deliver this news to all of [[Meiyerditch]] at [[Ver Sinhaza]]. Safalaan proposes to confront Ranis during this speech.\n\n===The Taste of Hope===\n'''(''Please Note: '''''<nowiki/>''This is a hard boss fight, so bring enough [[food]], [[prayer potions]], and combat boosts!''''')'''\n\n<nowiki/>'''(''Please Note: '''''<nowiki/>''[[Rings of recoil]] do not work on this boss.''')'''''[[File:A Taste of Hope - confronting Ranis.png|thumb|230px|The player confronts Ranis Drakan during his announcement.]]\nReturn to [[Ver Sinhaza]], and speak with [[Kael]] to begin the final fight with [[Ranis Drakan]].

He will use [[melee]] and [[magic]] attacks that can hit up to 20. He can also cast [[Blood Barrage]], which can heal him for half of the damage dealt. Occasionally, he will charge and attack and explode, hitting up to 30. The damage can be reduced by running away from him when he is charging the attack.\n[[File:A Taste of Hope - Ranis' blood bomb.png|thumb|230px|left|Ranis launches his blood bomb attack.]]\nAfter he reaches 65% of his health, he'll summon two level 87 [[vyrewatch]] and will fly airborne. Every now and then, he will throw blood bombs at where you are currently standing, which can hit up to 40. It should be noted that this attack '''can''' hit the vyrewatch, so it can be used to aid combat, especially at lower levels. When you kill the vyrewatch, you will fight Ranis again until he reaches 25% of his health, where he will then summon two vyrewatch again.\nAfter killing them, he will go berserk and attack the player. During this last phase, his attacks are much faster and accurate, but only have a max hit of 6. Using [[Protect from Melee]] will easily defeat him in the last phase.\n\nAfter killing Ranis, you will give an inspirational speech to the Meiyerditch citizens. If you disconnect after killing Ranis, talk to Kael again to restart the cut-scene with your speech.\n\nIf you die during the fight, your items can be retrieved from the chest located north-west of the noticeboard.\n\n===Finishing up===\nReturn to the [[Myreque Hideout|hideout]] under [[Old Man Ral]]'s house, and talk to [[Safalaan]]. He will congratulate you on defeating [[Ranis]], giving real hope to the citizens of [[Meiyerditch]]. In addition, Kael will give you [[Drakan's medallion]] that he recovered from Ranis' corpse.[[File:A Taste of Hope - Vanescula and Vanstrom.png|thumb|250px|Vanescula and Vanstrom discover Ranis' corpse.]]\nMeanwhile, [[Vanescula Drakan]] and [[Vanstrom Klause]] visit Ranis' corpse, with Vanstrom exclaiming that [[Lord Drakan]] will be displeased, while Vanescula tells him that she is counting on that.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = A Taste of Hope\n|image = [[File:A Taste of Hope reward scroll.png|center]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n*[[Ivandis flail]] - A weapon that can damage the [[vyrewatch]]\n*[[Drakan's medallion]] - An amulet that can teleport players to the [[Theatre of Blood]]\n*[[Tome of experience (A Taste of Hope)|Tome of experience]], granting 2,500 experience to any three skills of the player's choosing (level 35 or over).

You cannot enter through the Dorgesh-Kaan entrance this time (it will say the staircase is closed), so you must go to the Lumbridge swamp cave entrance and meet the goblin warriors who will be helping you.\n\nNow, go to the [[Lumbridge Swamp]], and talk to the goblin sergeants, [[Sergeant Slimetoes]] and [[Sergeant Mossfists]]. They should be near the entrance to the Lumbridge Swamp Caves (make sure you have your [[Light sources|light source]] for this part).\n[[File:Another Slice Of H.A.M - getting past guards.png|thumb|220px|Hiding behind the boxes.]]\nClimb down the entrance to the caves and next to the rope should be another ladder. Go down it, and you will briefly see a [[H.A.M. Guard]] before he runs away to get reinforcements. Now, talk to the goblins. Tell one to wait behind, and run down the hallway going into the room off to the east side, hiding while the guards run past. Go down by the boxes, and get one more guard to come out. Tell the second goblin to wait there, and go back to the room. Then, go past them towards the ladder, but run back when the final guard starts coming, and make sure he sees the goblin. Another method is to hide in the closet while the first two guards pass. Then walk out and hide behind boxes, and while another guard comes walk toward the final guard, and he will head toward the goblins, and you are now safe. During this entire part in the tunnel make sure you aren't seen by any guards that are not attacking a goblin or you will be sent back to the swamp and have to start this section over again. Alternatively, try luring the guards over to the goblins. Eventually, make your way all the way down the hallway, avoiding the guards, to the ladder at the other end. Ensure all of the guards see the goblins, and then walk past them, and go down the ladder.\n\n===Another Sigmund showdown===\n[[File:Another Slice Of H.A.M - Zanik tied up.png|thumb|200px|Zanik, tied up.]]'''<span class=\"\" style=\"color:red\">Warning:</span>''' '''If you die in this room you will lose your items.

Now, he will get hit, but he also seems to have a high [[Defence]]. Low levels be warned. If you attempt to untie [[Zanik]] whilst the fight is in progress, you will be hit for around 10 [[Hitpoints]] of damage. \n\n===The end===\n[[File:Another Slice Of H.A.M - train system opening.png|thumb|left|200px|The grand opening of the train line.]]\nWhen he is defeated, he will teleport away.

Upon entering the cave, right across from you will be a crack between two dwarf statues, which you should enter. From there, talk to the\u00a0[[Dwarven Ferryman]]\u00a0(make sure not to talk to the boatman) for a ride across the river, which will cost 2 [[coins]] or be free if you have a [[ring of charos (a)]] equipped.\n*If you take the [[minecart]] from the [[Grand Exchange]], go north-west from the carts to the [[Dwarven Boatman]] and take the boat (free) to reach the Ferryman at the entrance.\n*'''After talking to the Ferryman, to your north is the quest start.''' Go to the east and go around the rock wall blocking you. Speak to [[Dondakan]] to begin the quest after asking, ''\"Why are you firing a cannon at a wall?\"'' and ''\"So why were you trying to get through the rock again?\"'' Finally, choose ''\"Sounds interesting!\"''\n*Dondakan will ask you to get further information about the rock and tell you to talk to the Librarian, so return to the other side of the river, paying 2 coins again or crossing for free with the ring. This time, speak with the\u00a0Dwarven Boatman\u00a0to be taken to Keldagrim. If you have not started [[The Giant Dwarf]], you will be presented with a small cutscene introducing the area and you will be taken by guards as well as having the option to start The Giant Dwarf.\n[[File:Keldagrim map.png|thumb|200px|The dwarven boatman and ferryman are south of the River Kelda, and Dondakan can be reached by paying the ferryman 2 coins and going north.]]\n*You can talk to the Librarian on the Western side of Keldagrim, but it won't do much. Instead, go into the western part of the [[Trading Consortium]]. Look for the area with an [[anvil]] on the minimap in the palace and speak with the [[Dwarven Engineer|engineer]].\n*You will be told to speak with [[Rolad]] located at the [[Dwarven Mine]] entrance camp next to [[Ice Mountain]]. To get there, either teleport to [[Falador]] or the [[Edgeville Monastery|Monastery]] and walk the distance, or take the mine carts located in the southeastern portion of Keldagrim for 150 coins (75 coins if you have the ring of charos (a)). If you took the carts, head south, east, then north and exit the mine.\n*Rolad is inside the eastern house at the camp. He will ask you to find the pages from a book giving you information about the rock.\n*:'''Note:''' Make sure to fully complete the dialogue otherwise the pages won't appear.\n*All three pages are found in the Dwarven Mine. Note that the pages may require multiple attempts to be obtained:\n*#The [[Book page 1|first page]] can be found by killing [[scorpion]]s in the southeastern area of the mines.\n*#The [[Book page 2|second page]] is found when searching the mining carts.\n*#The [[Book page 3|third page]] is found by mining most [[Mining#Mineable items|ore]] rocks inside the mine. ([[Adamantite rock]]s do not work, and neither does [[coal]].)\n*Return to Rolad when you have found all three [[pages]], and he will give you the [[Dwarven lore]]. When you have the choice, you can answer 'Of course', or lie to him and keep it. Read the book, and then '''keep it for later'''. '''If you need a [[Ammo mould|cannonball mould]], purchase it from [[Nulodion]] in the western house next door to Rolad.'''\n*Head back to Dondakan; if your house is in Rellekka, teleport there and head east to the Dwarven Ferryman, or go via the mine carts ''(paying another 150 coins or 75 with a ring of charos (a))''\u00a0and Dwarven Boatman and Dwarven Ferryman. (Alternatively, if you have access to [[Blast Furnace]] or have completed [[Ratcatchers]], you can use the [[Minigame Group Finder]].) Speak with Dondakan. He wants a material that is stronger than [[runite]] and [[granite]]. This is where your [[gold bar]]s come in handy.\n*Go to any [[furnace]] with a gold bar ''(you need the other three for later; do not make all four at once with the [[drop trick]] since your character can only carry one at a time)'' and your cannonball ammo mould, and make a [[Cannon ball (Between a Rock...)|golden cannonball]]. The closest furnace is the one in Rellekka, which you can use if you have completed [[The Fremennik Trials]]. There is one furnace at [[Zanaris]] also. Another option is to take the fairy ring to Edgeville or head back to the mine carts in South-east Keldagrim and take Cart 3 to the Grand Exchange; then, use the furnace in Edgeville by using the shortcut from the Grand Exchange to Edgeville (21 [[Agility]] required).\n*When you are finished, give the cannonball to Dondakan. When he fires it, the cannonball will disappear through the wall. He will then ask to fire '''you''' through the wall, but he needs the schematics to change the cannon to be able to fire a human. You will also need to make yourself a [[gold helmet]] (requires 50 Smithing) if you don't want your head to explode when you hit the wall.\n*:'''Tip:''' Smithing a golden helmet in the [[Resource Area]] is a medium [[Wilderness Diary]] task.\n*There are a set of four (4) schematics:\n*#The first [[Schematic (Dondakan)|schematic]] is given to you by Dondakan.\n*#The [[Schematics (Dwarf Engineer)|second one]] is given by the engineer you spoke to earlier back in Keldagrim, by the anvil in the western palace bottom floor. You can make your golden helmet while you're here; use your gold bars on an anvil. ''(Don't forget your [[hammer]]!) (If you do make it here, you may want to bank it before you get the other pages, as it is very heavy and will bring your run energy down very fast while running around for the other schematics.)''\n*#Read to the last page of the Dwarven lore book, and you will find another [[Base schematics|schematic page]].\n*#Teleport to [[Camelot]], head east, and enter the shortcut that goes under [[White Wolf Mountain]], or go back to Keldagrim via the mine cart, and this time, take the mine cart to White Wolf Mountain ''(this ride costs 100 coins for one trip)''. Go to the small bar area, and speak with [[Khorvak]]. He will ask for a [[dwarven stout]]. You can take one off the table, and give it to him, or refuse and enjoy a funny piece of dialogue about ''RuneScape'' and alcoholics. Either way, you will receive the [[Schematics (Khorvak)|final schematic]].\n*Once you have all schematics, click 'assemble' on the one Dondakan gave you. You will be shown all schematics, but they will not make any sense. What you must do here is move the schematics one by one so that they fit with the original schematic. Select and show one at a time, rotate and move them to fit. It may be easiest to use the human stick figure legs, torso, and head to position each of the pieces correctly. This part should be quite simple. Be aware that even if you the pieces in the correct relative position, you might need to select them all and move them together to the correct position on the screen. Once you put them all in place, the screen will show: ''\"That's it! It all makes sense now! If you were a dwarf, that is...\"''.\n[[File:Between a Rock\u2026 schematics.png|frame|centre]]\n*Travel back to Keldagrim, bank, get [[combat gear]], [[pickaxe]], and if needed, go back to the\u00a0engineer in the\u00a0Trading Consortium so that you can make your helmet by using your remaining (3) gold bars on the anvil if you haven't made it already.\n[[File:Between a Rock\u2026 second thoughts.png|thumb|220px|Second thoughts before launch...]]\n*Equip the golden helmet; make sure you have a pick because '''any gold in inventory will disappear'''. Go back to Dondakan with the schematics and the items needed to kill the level 75-125 enemy. Once you are ready, ask Dondakan to shoot you into the rock.\n[[File:Between a Rock\u2026 open fire.png|thumb|220px|... Too late!]]\n*To fight the [[Arzinian Being of Bordanzan]], you will need to mine at least six (6) [[gold ore]]. Otherwise, it will keep regenerating its hitpoints. ''Mining 15 is highly recommended as this will lower the combat level of the boss from 125 to 75.'' Make sure you keep this gold in your inventory. '''You only have eight (8) minutes to mine the gold and defeat the avatar; if you take off your gold helmet, you will be teleported back to Dondakan.'''\n[[File:Between a Rock\u2026 fighting arzinian avatar.png|thumb|220px|left|Fighting the Arzinian Avatar]]\n*When you feel you have enough gold, go to the centre of the area, where you will find a set of flames. Go through the first set of flames and talk to the second set. While talking to the flames, the Arzinian Avatar representing the demon will come and attack you. The spirit will attack with [[Magic]], [[Melee]] or [[Ranged]], whichever is the natural weakness to your strongest on the [[combat triangle]].\nYou can use [[Prayer]] for an easy fight; the spirit shouldn't take too long to kill. If you are close to dying, you can take your gold helmet off, which will teleport you outside of the rock, next to Dondakan.\n*When you have defeated the spirit, you will be teleported back out of the rock.

Don't stay too close to the bait, but make sure it is in visible range. On a successful lure, a chompy bird\u00a0will appear.

When you talk to him, he says that although he can move you over the wall, it is too risky as the watchtower guards are too close to the wall. The guards need to be distracted so that you can find an opportunity to enter the city.\n\nHead to the small watchtower along the wall, directly north of [[Omart]]. Stand in the corner where the two spiked fences meet, use the [[bird feed]] on the watchtower fence, then click the cage in your inventory.\n\nGo back and talk to [[Omart]], who will call out to his assistant, [[Kilron]], to throw over the rope ladder. Climb over the ladder into [[West Ardougne]].\n\n===Infiltrating the Mourner HQ===\n[[File:Mourner Tunnels.png|thumb|200px|Mourner HQ is due northeast of West Ardougne.]]\nHead to the [[Mourner Headquarters|Mourners' headquarters]] located in the northeastern corner of the city. Try to enter, but you will not be allowed in by the [[mourner]]s. Go around the headquarters to the northern part, where you can see a cauldron being cooked in the backyard. Pick up the [[rotten apple]] laying on the ground just to the west, and squeeze through a gap in the fence into the backyard.\n\n'''Right click on the rotten apple and use it on the stew that is brewing in the cauldron, otherwise you will eat it'''. Squeeze back through the fence and walk around to the front of the building, and attempt to go inside again. One of the mourners will tell you that you're not permitted inside because several mourners are ill with food poisoning and are waiting for a doctor.\n[[File:Nurse Sarah location.png|thumb|120px|Nurse Sarah's house.]]\nHead to [[nurse Sarah]]'s house - the large building southwest of the [[West Ardougne]] church. Search the cupboard in the northern part of her house to obtain a [[doctors' gown]]. Equip the gown, and go back to the headquarters. The professional attire will easily fool the mourners into letting you into their base. For all subsequent visits to the headquarters during the quest, the gown must be worn at all times.\n\nGo upstairs and kill a mourner. A [[Key (Biohazard)|key]] will automatically be placed in the player's inventory. Use the key on the gate to get inside the caged room. Search the crates to find [[Elena]]'s [[distillator]].\n\nExit the headquarters, and head back to [[Kilron]] at the southeastern corner of [[West Ardougne]]. He will help the player get back over into [[East Ardougne]]. Alternatively, players can head through the sewers as they are no longer blocked. Go to Elena and give her the distillator.\n\n===Getting the touch paper===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Falador teleport]] or [[amulet of glory]] (optional), [[brown apron]] (optional) or [[House teleport]] if your house is located in [[Rimmington]]''\n[[File:Chemist location.png|thumb|200px|The chemist's location.]]\nElena gives you 4 samples, all of which are fragile and will break upon teleporting. It is advisable to use the drop trick to get at least 2 sets, in case any of them break. Bank the 4 items Elena gives you (there is a bank east of her house, beware that one of the samples resembles an empty vial, however it is not) then teleport to [[Falador]] or [[Draynor Village]], or the [[explorer's ring 2|cabbage patch]]. '''''Teleporting or accepting [[random events]] with the samples causes them to break and you will need to talk to Elena again to get more. Travelling in a ship will not damage the samples.'''''

Talk to each of them to give them their respective vials. Make sure to give each bottle to the right person, or you will not receive them when you get to [[Varrock]]. If this happens, you will need to go back to Elena for more chemicals, and go back to Rimmington again.\n\nGive Chancy the [[liquid honey]], Da Vinci the [[ethenea]], and Hops the [[sulphuric broline]].

Equip a priest gown set (you can buy one from [[Thessalia's Fine Clothes]] or [[Fancy dress shop owner]] to the north of Guidor), withdraw the plague sample and touch paper from Varrock east bank and proceed to the fenced area to the southeast.\n\nHead to the fenced-in enclosure in southeastern Varrock. The guard will search you when you try and pass through the gate. The guard will confiscate the '''vials''' if you try and pass with them '''but the plague sample is safe to bring through'''. Go to the [[Dancing Donkey Inn]] with the plague sample and talk to Hops, Da Vinci, and Chancy to get the vials back. Having a full inventory will require you to obtain a new set from Elena. '''<u>Do not pass back through the gate at this point or your vials will be confiscated on return!</u>''' (If you have forgotten the touch paper or plague sample, drop the vials at the gate, exit, run to Varrock east bank for the items, and quickly run back to pick up the vials)\n\n'''If you do not bring the plague sample or papers with you, you can go to Varrock east bank and retrieve them, drop the vials outside, and [[telegrab]] them into the gated area.'''\n\n===Secrets===\n'''''Items required:''' The [[plague sample]], [[touch paper]], a [[priest gown]].''\n\nEquip your [[priest gown]] and head to [[Guidor]]'s house in the southeastern corner of the gated area. Talk to Guidor to give him the vials and sample, and tell him that [[Elena]] has sent a sample that needs to be processed. After analysing it, he will come to a surprising conclusion. He tells you that the plague is just a lie.\n\n===Return to Ardougne===\nReturn to [[Ardougne]], and talk to Elena. When you tell her that Guidor found nothing in his results, she suggests that the plague must be a hoax and that you should speak to the person on top of this - [[King Lathas]] of [[East Ardougne]]. King Lathas is located just south of Elena's house, in his throne-room on the {{FloorNumber|2}} of the East [[Ardougne Castle]].\n\nWhen told that the plague is in fact a hoax, the King replies that he did it for the best of his people, and that it protects them from a \"far greater danger\". He then tells the player about the journey of [[King Tyras]] - the king of [[West Ardougne]] and King Lathas's brother - towards the west and that he has been corrupted by a dark lord after drinking from the Chalice of Eternity. Hence, the wall has been erected between the cities to protect [[East Ardougne]] and in turn, all of ''[[RuneScape]]''.\n\n'''Congratulations!

If your [[Smithing]] level is high enough (3 for the bronze medium helmet, and 26 for the iron chainbody), you can just smith the chain and the helmet. If not, you'll have to buy them from the shops listed above or buy them from the [[Grand Exchange]].\n\n==Walkthrough==\n===Starting out===\n'''''Items required:''' None.''\n\nTalk to [[Sir Amik Varze]], who can be found on the {{FloorNumber|3}} of the western part of [[White Knights' Castle]].\u00a0He will tell you that he needs a spy. He wants you to spy on the [[Kinshra|Black Knights]] for him at their fortress located northeast of [[Falador]] near\u00a0[[Ice Mountain]]. He wants you to find out what their new weapon is and destroy it. A free inventory space is needed for a dossier handed to you by Sir Amik Varze. The dossier will self-destruct once you read it, meaning that you could drop and then pick up an item if you have a full inventory.\n\n===Infiltrating the fortress===\n'''''Items required:''' An [[iron chainbody]] and a [[bronze med helm]].''\n[[File:Black Knights' Fortress - Area.png|thumb|220px|The fortress is due northeast of Falador and slightly west of the Monastery.]]\nMake your way to the [[Black Knights' Fortress (location)|Black Knights' Fortress]]. It is northeast of the [[Dwarven Mine]] and the [[Oracle]], northwest of the [[Edgeville Monastery|Monastery]]. Run through the [[Black Knight]]s, as they will attack you because they are naturally [[Aggressiveness|aggressive]]. Enter the door to the south surrounded by guards. Make sure you are wearing the [[Iron chainbody]] and the [[Bronze med helm]], or they won't let you enter.\n\nOnce inside, the wall right in front of you can be pushed. Push it to enter a small room. Climb up the ladder in this small room and then up the ladder immediately to the right of it. Climb down the ladder just south, go through a door to the east and then up another ladder. Climb down the ladder beside the one you just came up and you will end up in a room with a chaos altar. Open the door and run to avoid the knights. Climb down the ladder to the southwest, and you will find yourself in a small room. In this small room, there should be a grill. Click on it to listen.

You will be stopped from opening the door, since a guard will talk to you. You may have to kill an aggressive black knight in the room before you can complete the dialog. ''If you are having trouble with the aggressive knight, you should hop worlds. You could also try to lure him away and quickly confirm the door dialog by pressing spacebar, 2, spacebar. ''He will say that there is an important meeting going on and they'll kill anyone who gets in. Say you don't care and that you're going in anyway. Run from the knights and climb up the ladder on the northern wall of the room. Walk east and south and look for a wall you can push. Push the wall to see a hole. '''Right-click''' your [[cabbage]] so that you do not eat it, and use it with the hole that should be in the room. You will hear the witch groan, meaning you destroyed the weapon.\n\n===Return to Falador===\n'''''Items required:''' None.''\n\nNow, go back to [[Sir Amik Varze]], and tell him you sabotaged the weapon.

Ask if he has any interesting news. He will tell you that they have found an interesting island north of [[Morytania]], and that they believe it may be of archaeological significance. They are in the process of making the final preparations for the voyage, and he has recommended you to the [[barge foreman]], who requested the aid of a qualified and experienced adventurer. Agree to help, and make your way to the [[Digsite]].\n\n===The finishing touches===\nHead to the [[canal barge]] north of the [[Digsite]]. There, speak to the [[barge foreman]] in front of the barge. They are in the final stages of preparation, but there are a few minor adjustments he'd like to make to the barge before getting the crew ready. He requires a sturdier type of wood to keep the barge afloat; [[magic logs]] will not do, since they had peculiar side effects (which you will learn later). He will require a high-grade wood found only in the [[Zeah|distant Western lands]] - redwood.\n\nThe barge foreman will instruct the player to talk to the [[Sawmill operator]] at the [[Sawmill]] north-west from the barge.\n\nTravel to the [[Lumber Yard]] and speak to the Sawmill operator. In order to obtain redwood planks, he has arranged a fairly generous deal between himself and the sawmill in [[Great Kourend]]'s [[Woodcutting Guild]]. He will give you a [[sawmill proposal]], which you will have to deliver to the Woodcutting Guild.\n\nNow, travel to the Woodcutting Guild in the [[Hosidius House]] using your skills necklace, and hand the proposal to the Woodcutting Guild Sawmill operator. If you don't have the requirements to enter the Woodcutting Guild, try to open the eastern gate to the guild to complete this step; [[Berry (NPC)|Berry]] will sign it on behalf of the guild's sawmill operator.\n\nReturn to the [[Varrock]] Sawmill operator, and give him the [[sawmill agreement]].\n\n===The cursed voyage===\n[[File:Bone Voyage.png|thumb|250px|The completed barge.]]\nGo back to the [[barge foreman]], who will ask you to board the [[barge]]. Speak to the [[barge guard]], and he will let you board the barge. On the barge, speak to the [[Lead Navigator]]. He will ask you if you are aware of the previous attempts at the expedition. Pick the first option if you wish to know what happened. Otherwise, pick the second to skip the dialogue.\n\n*The first barge had some serious design flaws... it didn't float.\n*The second barge suffered from 'feature creep'. Senior museum staff stuck their oar in and added unnecessary features: 'go-faster stripes', a portable fossil centrifuge and a walk-on mini-museum. Needless to say, it had... buoyancy issues.\n*The third barge made it out to sea, but a special sealant was used that attracted sea monsters. They didn't make it very far.\n*The fourth also used a special sealant, this one attracted icebergs.\n*The fifth barge crashed into the sixth.\n*We lost the seventh one.\n*The eighth barge is still here, we think. An accident involving a magical explosion and some talking [[anchovies]] means that it is now believed to reside 12 seconds out of phase.\n*The ninth version was built with [[magic logs]]. The barge gained some form of rudimentary sentience. It developed serious depression and ran itself aground near [[Crandor]].\n\nThus, he will believe the voyage is cursed, and will refuse to sail unless you can ensure the safety of the crew from this curse. He asks you to talk to some experienced sailors in the [[Rusty Anchor Inn]] in [[Port Sarim]].\n\nTalk to [[Jack Seagull]] in the Rusty Anchor Inn, and ask him if he has ever made any cursed voyages. He will claim that you need a lucky [[bone charm]], and that you should speak to the [[Odd Old Man]] in [[Silvarea]] to get one. [[Ahab]] will interrupt, claiming that a '[[potion of sealegs]]' will have you sail the voyage unscathed. You decide that you'll ask the navigators which one they'll prefer to have.\n\nReturn to the Lead Navigator. He will want the potion of sealegs, but the [[Junior Navigator]] wants the bone charm instead.\n\nSpeak to the [[Apothecary]] in [[Varrock]]. He will require a [[marrentill potion (unf)]] and two bottles of [[vodka]]. Speak to him again to receive the potion of sealegs.\n\nVisit the Odd Old Man by the [[Silvarea mine]], north of the [[Digsite]], and ask for a lucky charm. Tell him that you're making a cursed voyage to receive the bone charm. You can head south and east of [[Tolna's rift]] to quickly return to the barge.\n\n===The \"cursed\" voyage===\n[[File:Bone Voyage - sailing the ocean blue.png|thumb|250px|Sailing the treacherous waters to Fossil Island.]]\nReturn to the [[barge]], and give the [[Junior Navigator]] the [[bone charm]] and the [[Lead Navigator]] the [[potion of sealegs]].\n\n[[File:Barge controls.png|thumb|left|The barge controls.]]\n\nUnsurprisingly, the potion has made everyone except the Junior Navigator pass out.

Bill is the captain of ''The Adventurous'', a ship which he claims is the finest ever to sail the seas. He needs a pirate to help him leave the port, but none will sail with him, not even his crew.\n\nLast night, he had a heated argument with the captain of another ship, wherein the captain threatened to sink ''The Adventurous'' and put his crew \"to the sword\". Scared, all his crewmembers have abandoned him and he has no choice but to sail back to his home land.\n\nSeeing his dilemma and wanting to be a pirate, you offer to help him. Although he doubts your plundering abilities, Bill accepts your help and tells you to meet him on his ship. Go to the Port Phasmatys docks, and board the easternmost ship, ''The Adventurous''. Speak with Bill to set sail for [[Mos Le'Harmless]] and begin your journey as a pirate.\n\n===Under attack!===\n[[File:Enemy ship attacks.png|thumb|220px|''The Adventurous'' is attacked by an enemy ship.]]\nAs soon as you leave port, you see a [[cutscene]], where an enemy pirate ship starts firing on ''The Adventurous'', destroying the ship's hull and cannons. [[Bill Teach|Bill]] calms you down and tells you to first take care of the enemy's cannon.\n\nHe suggests you grab some [[fuse]] and [[rope]] from the ship's bottom deck. Climb down to the bottom deck and search the ''repair locker'', to take out six ropes. Search the ''gun locker'' located near the repair locker, and pick up a fuse. In the southern corner, there is also a [[tinderbox]]; grab it.\n[[File:On the enemy ship.png|thumb|220px|A player is attacked by a [[pirate]] on the enemy ship.]]\nClimb up the ship's ladder to the main deck, and use the climbing net to climb up the main mast. Use your rope on the hoisted sail of ''The Adventurous'' to swing over to the enemy ship. If you fail the jump, your [[run energy]] will drop considerably.\n\nThe ship is populated by level 57 [[pirate]]s. If you need to escape from them for a moment, climb up the net on the main mast. For your job, find the powder barrel next to the cannon on the west side of the deck and use the fuse on the powder barrel. Light the fuse to blow up the barrel and the cannon. Climb back on the main mast using the net, and using a rope, swing back over to ''The Adventurous'' - ''if you forgot to bring a second rope, you can find one in the southwestern corner of the main deck of the enemy pirate's ship.''\n\n====Shielding====\n[[File:Repairing hull.png|thumb|220px|Repairing the ship's hull.]]\nNow that you've controlled the offence, you need to build your defence. Talk to [[Bill Teach|Bill]], and he'll want you to repair the damaged hull. Climb down the ship's ladder and search the repair locker for:\n*6 [[Repair plank]]s\n*30 [[Tacks]]\n*3 [[Swamp paste]]\n*A [[hammer]]\nEach of the three holes takes two planks, ten tacks and one swamp paste to fix. When you have enough resources, a message in the chat interface will say so, if you try to get more than is needed.\n\nFor each hole, use a repair plank and then a swamp paste on the ship hull to patch it up.\n\nThen, go talk to Bill again.\n\n====Retaliation!====\nFor attacking your ship, the enemy [[pirate]]s need to be taught a lesson. [[Bill Teach|Bill]] asks you to pillage the enemy ship and bring back their booty. Return to the main deck, climb the net again, use a [[rope]] on the hoisted sail, and swing back over to the enemy ship.\n\nClimb down the ship's ladder. Steal from the chest, loot the crate and ransack the barrel for enemy [[plunder]]; you will need to wait for it to respawn. You need 10 plunder, but looting all three once only provides you with 6 plunder, 3 being from the chest, 2 from the crate and 1 from the barrel. It can take anywhere up to 5 minutes for the plunder to respawn; however, you can simply log out and log back in for the plunder to respawn. The barrel will respawn fastest, then the crates and finally, the chest.\n\nAfter you have ten plunder in your [[inventory]], return to the main deck, and return to ''The Adventurous''.\n\nClimb down the ship's ladder, and use your plunder on the plunder storage at the back. If you leave the ship, you will lose the plunder and have to steal it back over again. Also, you can only store ten plunder; Bill will confiscate any surplus in your inventory when you talk to him.\n\n====Into Davy Jones' Locker====\n[[File:Using ship cannon.png|thumb|220px|Using the ship's cannon to retaliate.]]\nFinally, [[Bill Teach|Bill]] wants you to prepare a send-off for the enemy. He wants to give the enemy [[pirate]]s a blast, from the cannon. The aim here is to prepare the cannon (follow steps below) and to fire the cannon when the pirates are in front of the cannon on the pirate ship, so that you will hit them. Follow these steps to repair and fire the cannon:\n\nClimb down the ship's ladder, search the gun locker, and take a [[cannon barrel]]. Trying to take anything else at this point will result in the message \"You do not need a [item name] right now.\" Climb back up and left-click the [[broken cannon]] to fix it (The cannon will have the option \"Repair broken cannon\").\n\nTalk to Bill again, then go below and search the gun locker for a [[ramrod]], a few [[fuse]]s and a [[canister|cannon canister]]. Return to the main deck, and choose the take-powder option from the powder barrel next to the cannon.\n\n[[Gunpowder]] can be obtained from the powder barrel located right next to the cannon, just left click the 'take powder' option.\n#Use gunpowder on the cannon.\n#Use the ramrod on the cannon.\n#Use a canister on the cannon.\n#Use a fuse on the cannon.\n#Fire the cannon!\n#Use the ramrod on the cannon again to clean it out.\n\nIf you miss, use the ramrod on the cannon to clean it out and then repeat the steps, until you score a hit. If you don't clean the cannon, it will explode from the previous unused gunpowder. If this happens, replace the broken barrel with a new one from the gun locker.\n\nWhen you hit the pirates with the canisters, talk to Bill. He tells you to sink the enemy pirate ship by blasting holes in its hull; three would be enough. Go down below, and search the gun locker to take three [[cannon ball]]s. Up on the main deck, clean the cannon out with a ramrod and then repeat the steps - '''''except for loading the cannon with a cannonball this time, and not a canister''''' - until you have hit the enemy ship three times.\n\n===Mos Le'Harmless===\n[[File:Cabin Fever Le'Fiette - Teach.png|thumb|220px|[[Mama]] and [[Bill Teach|Bill]] chat.]]\nFollowing your third hit of the enemy pirate ship, you see a [[cutscene]] with [[Bill Teach]] talking with [[Mama|Mama Le'Fiette]] in [[The Other Inn]]. Bill then thanks you and gives you a [[Book o' piracy]], to add \"pirate\" to your vocabulary as your ineptitude at speaking \"pirate\" annoyed him to no end in the voyage.{{Clear}}\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Cabin Fever\n|image = [[File:Cabin Fever reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = *{{Skill clickpic|Crafting|7,000}} [[Crafting]] [[experience]]\n*{{Skill clickpic|Smithing|7,000}} [[Smithing]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Agility|7,000}} [[Agility]] experience\n*10,000 [[Coins]] (only if you speak to [[Bill Teach]] after the quest)\n*Access to [[Mos Le'Harmless]]\n*Access to kill [[cave horror]]s\n*The [[Book o' piracy]]\n*[[Charter ship]] prices are halved\n*Ability to play the [[Trouble Brewing]] minigame.\n}}\n==Required for completing==\n*[[The Great Brain Robbery]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*During the [[Ranged]] level check for the quest, [[Bill Teach]] asks the player about shooting an albatross.

Agree to help him, and he will give you an [[enchanted scroll]], you must use a feather on it to create an [[enchanted quill]]. If you haven't got one already, a feather can be easily obtained from [[Gerrant's Fishy Business]] in [[Port Sarim]].\n\nWith the [[enchanted quill]] in your inventory, you will have to speak to the general store owners of Great Kourend:\n\n<gallery>\nVeos location.png|Speak to Veos to begin quest\nLeenz location.png|[[Leenz]] from the [[Piscarilius House]]\nHorace location.png|[[Horace]] from the [[Hosidius House]]\nQuartermaster Briget location.png|[[Jennifer (Shayzien House)|Jennifer]] from the [[Shayzien House]]\nMunty location.png|[[Munty]] from the [[Lovakengj House]]\nRegath location.png|[[Regath]] from the [[Arceuus House]]\n</gallery>\n\n'''NOTE:''' If you are using the [[Teleport to Kourend]] spell to get around Great Kourend, talk to [[Leenz]], north of [[Veos]] before teleporting, as this is the one house where teleporting doesn't shorten the running distance. After that, teleport to Great Kourend and travel to the next general store, repeating the process as needed.\n\n[[File:Enchanted_Quill_Damage.gif|thumb|160px|A player taking damage from the enchanted quill]]\n\nSpeak to a store owner, and ask them about their respective houses. Ask why someone should gain favour in their respective houses. When you are receiving information from the [[Regath]], the [[Arceuus House]] general store owner, the quill will mysteriously glow and damage your hand! You will not take any damage, however.\n\nOnce you've spoken to every single general store owner, a mysterious voice whispers to you that you must return to [[Veos]]. He will take your quill and scroll. You then tell [[Veos]] about your hand being damaged, and he says the client apologises, as the mention of the [[Dark Altar]] \"provoked emotions\".\n\n[[Veos]] will then ask you to take a [[mysterious orb]] and activate it when near the [[Dark Altar]]. The Dark Altar is found north of the [[Arceuus House]], which can be reached relatively quickly by teleporting to the [[Wintertodt Camp]] via a [[games necklace]], running south following the path that goes west a bit, until you reach the dark area, and then east. The dark altar is at the end of the purple crystals.  If you have access to [[Fairy rings]], use the code {{Fairycode|CIS}} to get close to the [[Dark Altar]]. The [[Dark Altar]] is located north-east of the {{Fairycode|CIS}} fairy ring.

However, the client will foil the attempt, asking the player if they truly thought that he could be manipulated by Charos' feeble magic. He decides to tell the player due to their efforts, and reveals himself to be [[Xeric]], a tyrant who ruled [[Great Kourend]] nearly 1,030 years ago.\n\n===Copper's collar===\n[[File:Copper's crimson collar detail.png|left]]\nA set of [[wolf bones]] can be used on Veos. The bones will remind him of Copper, his pet wolf - a loyal, brave and gentle wolf who wore a crimson collar. When Veos was travelling in the [[Fremennik Province]]s, he and his wolf (who was 19 years old) were ambushed by a group of feral foxes, and suffered fatal wounds. Veos ran away, and he sought to search for his remains, to no avail. Offer to help him, then travel to the Fremennik Province.\n\n[[Fox]]es can only be found just north of the [[Sinclair Mansion]], across the river. Kill them until they drop [[Copper's crimson collar]].\n\nOnce you obtain the collar, return to Veos, who will be grateful for your help.\n\n==Required for completing==\n*[[Dragon Slayer II]]\n*[[The Queen of Thieves]]\n*[[The Depths of Despair]]\n*[[Tale of the Righteous]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*The quest cannot be completed by talking to [[Veos]] in [[Port Sarim]], the dialogue option is only available in [[Great Kourend]].\n*Prior to [[Update:Tale of the Righteous and Kourend Favour|an update]] on 19 April [[2018]], the quest permanently doubled the rate of gaining favour in all houses within Great Kourend.

This will be followed by a rather strange [[cutscene]], but is important to keep note of the emotes the penguin does, as it shows the emote greeting code that is unique for every player. There are eight different penguin emotes in all, similar to the normal character [[emotes]], and the greeting will consist of three of those. If you need to see them again, click \"Use Lookout\" to watch the cutscene again. After the cutscene, speak to Larry and suggest to him that the behaviour of the penguins in the cutscene was suspicious.\n#Use the boat to return to the dock and speak to Larry again - now, here's where things get strange.

However, he will not give you the phrase but the penguin will ask for the following in return for it:\n#*A [[raw cod]], the penguins' favourite food.\n#*Use a [[ring of charos]] (a), a ring with powerful magic properties. You will not get the normal (Charm) option, the penguin simply provides the phrase.\n#When you have either the raw cod in your [[inventory]] or are wearing the ring, talk to the penguin in the zoo, and he will tell you that the secret phrase is ''do not trust the walrus''.\n\n===Intelligence===\n#Return to [[Lumbridge]]. Go to [[Fred the Farmer]]'s sheep pen and penguin suit up! Now, the penguins will tell you to talk to Fred the Farmer to see if he's an undercover agent for the humans.\n#:[[File:Bullying Fred.png|thumb|220px|Bullying [[Fred the Farmer|Fred]] in order to obtain the information from the disguised penguins.]]\n#Speak to Fred the Farmer about penguins and use either the bully option or warn option. Both work, and when you are done talking to Fred, return and speak with the penguin again. Pick either option in the conversation with the penguin and then they will give you the location of the outpost - it is on the [[Iceberg]] you visited earlier under what appears to be an avalanche. They will also give you a password ''cabbage''. Get one [[swamp tar]] and five [[feather]]s. Swamp tar [[Spawning|spawns]] in the [[Lumbridge Swamp]], and you can get feathers from killing [[chicken]]s. '''It is advised you steal a cowbell now from the nearby dairy cow before proceeding to next section of the quest'''.\n#Speak to [[Larry]], and he will teleport you to the Iceberg. Suit up to penguin again and head north-west until you see a [[KGP agent]] penguin, and use the emote greeting; then, tell him the password, and then he will ask you for an ID but, guess what, you don't have one!\n#Now, speak to [[Noodle]]. He's the black market merchant close to the KGP agent, and he'll trade you an ID and a report if you give him one swamp tar and five feathers.\n#:[[File:Debriefing.png|thumb|220px|Being debriefed by the [[KGP agent]].]]\n#Exchange the materials with Noodle for the [[Kgp id card|ID]] and another mission report, speak to the KGP agent, and he'll let you through; then, left click on the avalanche and you should see the option ''use avalanche'' and you will enter the outpost.\n#:'''Note:''' Whenever you wish to leave the outpost, simply removing the penguin suit will have you teleported back to Larry.\n#Once inside, go into the first room on the left (West), and talk to the KGP agent to be debriefed there; once done, head into the corridor on the other side of the room; you will now have to complete an [[Penguin agility course|agility course]].\n#:[[File:Penguin army.png|thumb|220px|The penguin army!]]\n#Once you have exited the door at the end of the corridor, you shall see a small [[cutscene]] showing a penguin army!

Follow the signs with arrows to the agility course, and when the path ends, just past some blue crates; turn past the crates to start the agility course.\n\n===Agility course===\n#Climb down the steps and into the water. Avoid the moving ice in the water. Climb the stepping stone at the end.\n#Jump to the next stepping stone. Jump to the five next stones. (If you fail you will take minor damage). Then, jump to the land again.\n#After you manage to cross, continue on the path unit you come to a shelf with icicles on it. Use the ''tread softly'' option to get across. You will have to repeat this several times at each shelf. If you fail, you will be hit taking a small damage.\n#Next, you will have to cross ice; this may prove a little annoying. You will take 2 damage each time you fail.

Ask the [[KGP agent]] in the booth to the left of the doors to let you in.

If you have access to the [[fairy ring]] network, you can get to a cow quickly by taking the boat back to [[Rellekka]], and using the fairy ring just east of the dock.

You have nothing to lose but your chains!\"\n**The posters in the penguin outpost are a reference to patriotic murals in communist countries.\n*Throughout the quest, the player will lie to the penguins by saying that he or she flew by flapping his or her wings really fast. In addition, if you have completed [[Enlightened Journey]], he or she will tell the truth saying that they flew in a hot-air balloon. If you have completed [[Between a Rock...]], he or she will say they were fired out of a cannon.\n*The secret phrase, ''do not trust the walrus'', might be a reference to Lewis Carroll's {{Wp|The Walrus and the Carpenter}}. The walrus invites some oysters to join them in a walk along the beach, the two titular characters get hungry and eat all of the oysters. {{wp|John Lennon}} wrote a song {{Wp|I Am the Walrus}} and commented ''\"It never dawned on me that Lewis Carroll was commenting on the capitalist and social system. ... the walrus was the bad guy in the story...\"''\n*The [[Lumbridge]] penguins in sheep's costume are similar to {{Wp|Wolf in sheep's clothing}}.\n*''\"Curiouser and curiouser\",'' said by the player just before talking to [[Fred the Farmer]], is a well known line from ''{{Wp|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland}}''.\n*[[Ping]] and [[Pong]] talk like {{Wp|Beatnik}}s who played {{Wp|Bongo drum}}s.\n**{{Wp|Cheech & Chong}} were a comedy duo who played stoned hippies.\n**{{Wp|Oingo Boingo}} is the name of a music band.\n*Ping says ''\"We need more cowbell\"'', a reference to the \"{{Wp|More Cowbell}}\" skit on NBC's popular late night show ''{{Wp|Saturday Night Live}}''.

He will tell you that they have been having problems getting in contact with their sister city of [[Menaphos]]. [[File:Contact! Menaphos cutscene.png|thumb|220px|[[Coenus]] and his men refuse to negotiate peacefully.]]\nTalk to the priest and ask him about ways of getting into Menaphos. Ask about any dungeons, and he will direct you to Jex.\n\nTalk to [[Jex]], who is in the northeastern part of the city in a building with a broken altar. He will tell you how to access the dungeons beneath the building.\n\nGo down a level and talk to the guard. He will sell you a [[torch]] for 200 [[coins]], and a [[tinderbox]] for 50 coins. A [[bullseye lantern]] is a better choice because it will go out less often, but you '''must''' take your tinderbox into the dungeon. It is strongly recommended that you take good [[food]], a tinderbox, a [[Light sources|light source]], an [[antipoison]] potion, and an emergency escape [[Teleportation|teleport]] such as the [[ectophial]]. Also, it is best not to bring any valuables in case of death.\n\n===Dungeon===\n[[File:Sophanem dungeon map.png|thumb|300px|A map of the [[Sophanem Dungeon]].]]\n:'''Note:''' The dungeon under [[Sophanem]] is very dangerous, and [[protection prayers]] are strongly advised for protection from the monsters that patrol the dungeon.\n\n'''Turn auto-retaliate off''' through the [[Combat]] tab, since it might cause you to waste some [[Prayer]] points fighting back, and/or also cause you to run into a trap, if you're hit at an inopportune moment. Go down the trapdoor and follow the dungeon around until you get to the ladder north of the southwestern corner using the [[Protect from Magic]] prayer.\n\nWhen following the route to the right, the player will only encounter [[scarab mage]]s. Therefore, '''use Protect from Magic and keep auto-retaliate off.'''\n\nIf you have enough protection, this level could be a shortcut going from the north middle ladder '''(2)''' to the southwestern ladder '''(6)'''. Then, go up, east, north, and west to the exit ladder.\n\n===Traps===\nThe dungeon is ridden with various types of traps, which should generally be avoided or bypassed.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Image\n!Description\n|-\n|[[File:Floor trap.png|150px]]\n|'''Floor trap - Spikes:''' Similar to the floor traps found in the [[Rogues' Den]] (but easier to see - \"X\" markings on floor), these can be avoided using [[Agility]] by selecting \"Search floor\". If you run over them, you will be hit for 14-17 [[hitpoints]].\n|-\n|[[File:Odd markings.png|150px]]\n|'''Wall trap:''' Similar to the wall traps in [[Rogues' Den]], these can be disabled by [[Thieving]] by selecting \"Search Odd markings\". If you run through them, you will be hit for 14-17 [[hitpoints]].\n|-\n|[[File:Wall crusher.png|150px]]\n|'''Crusher Blocks:''' These are also found in the pyramid in [[Icthlarin's Little Helper]]. Simply, move diagonally carefully around them. If you run into them, you will be hit for around 8 [[hitpoints]] of damage. (NOTE: You can run through these without taking damage by just clicking past them with run enabled).\n|-\n|[[File:Sand pit.png|150px]]\n|'''Sand pits:''' Barely visible circles on the ground. If you step on these, the ground will crack open and a [[Scarab swarm]] will come out. This can be avoided by walking around the pit.\n|-\n|[[File:Scarab trap.png|150px]]\n|'''Scarab trap:''' Similar to the pits in [[Desert Treasure]], these pits appear if you stand next to a wall spot with a scarab symbol on it. This will extinguish your [[Light sources|light source]] and cause you to fall down to the bottom level.\n|}\n:'''<font color=\"red\">Warning:</font>''' Unless you have a piece of [[Kandarin headgear]] or a bruma torch in your [[inventory]], your [[Light sources|light source]] can be extinguished at any time. If this happens, use a [[tinderbox]] to light it again.\n\nYou will also encounter [[Scarab mage]]s, [[Scarab swarm]]s, and [[Locust rider]]s. These can be very dangerous, and it is recommended you use [[Prayer]] against these foes. Scarab swarms can [[poison]] and will only appear if you step on a sand pit trap.\n\nThe ladders in the dungeon all lead to a '''much''' more dangerous second level of the dungeon. If you go down the wrong ladder or fall down a pit, you will be placed in the lower portion of the dungeon. There are level 98 and 106 locust riders and lots of Scarab mages. It is a [[multicombat area]], and your [[hitpoints]] will be reduced very quickly. Find a ladder and get out fast.\n\n===Kaleef's corpse===\nOnce you have found the correct ladder, follow the passage around until you come to the corpse of [[Kaleef]]. Search the corpse to get his [[Parchment (Contact!)|notes]], and read it afterwards.\n\nTravel slightly west and speak to [[Maisa]]. Tell her you have helped rescue [[Prince Ali]], who was being held in [[Draynor Village]], and that [[Leela]] assisted you. She will then trust you and tell you to speak to [[Osman]], Spy Master of [[Al Kharid]].\n\n===Osman===\nTravel to [[Al Kharid]], go north of the palace and speak to [[Osman]], try and convince him to come to [[Sophanem]] personally. Picking the \"Drive a wedge between the two cities\" option does the trick. Osman will then appear just outside the gates of Sophanem.\n[[File:Contact! - Osman sneaking.png|thumb|220px|[[Osman]] sneaks into the temple after knocking [[Jex]] out.]]\nBefore travelling back, equip yourself for a big fight. Emphasis on good [[food]], but a [[prayer potion]] may help as well. '''Don't forget your light source.''' [[Super potion set]]s are highly recommended if you're using [[melee]], as the monsters hit 20+, and the scarab is very difficult to hit if it gets lucky. [[Iban Blast]] and [[Ice Rush]] spells are extremely effective.\n\nTravel back to Sophanem. Osman will be just outside the gates. Talk to him again and suggest the secret entrance just north of the city. You will then see a [[cutscene]] where Osman sneaks past [[Jex]] into the caves below.\n\n===The final battle===\n[[File:Giant scarab appears.gif|thumb|220px|The [[Giant scarab]] manifests itself.]]\nTalk to Jex for some humorous dialogue regarding his attack if you wish. Go back through the [[Sophanem Dungeon]] to where you found the body of [[Kaleef]]. As soon as you go down the ladder, you will see another [[cutscene]] where a large beetle appears!\n\n'''Make sure you're well prepared. If you die during the fight, all items lost on death will vanish, and there is no way to reclaim them!'''\n\nTravel into the cave and fight the level 191 [[Giant scarab]], which hits up to 20 with [[melee]] and Ranged. It summons level 68 [[Locust rider]]s and [[Scarab mage]]s (which can also do 9 damage with [[poison]]) to aid it, which will attack the player at the same time. The riders will attack with Ranged or melee, and the mages will attack with [[Magic]], so you are being attacked by all three [[combat style]]s at once. It is recommended to defeat the magic-casters and rangers as soon as they spawn, but ignore the melee riders as your [[Prayer]] makes them harmless.\n\n'''If you're using melee,''' you will require pretty high stats (70 or better). [[Protect from Melee]] is recommended against the scarab, and having plenty of good [[food]] such as sharks is recommended, you may also need a prayer potion as the scarab has incredibly high defence and drags out the fight. Wearing [[dragonhide armour]] alongside mid-tier melee boots, gloves and helmet (dragon, [[Neitiznot]]) will help protect against both Magic and Ranged - anything lower than this will lead to relying on good hits to win the fight. You should kill the ranger or mager as soon as they spawn, as more will continuously spawn throughout the fight. Simply hit the scarab in-between spawns. \n[[File:Contact! giant scarab fight.png|thumb|220px|A player fighting the [[Giant scarab]].]]\n'''If you're using Ranged''', use a [[rune crossbow]] with [[broad bolts]] or higher, or use a [[crystal bow]]. Anything lower will cause problems, due to the scarab's high [[Defence]]. Use [[Karil the Tainted's equipment]] or [[black dragonhide armour]], and use the [[safespot]] also listed in the mage tips below. Doing range any other way is not very effective in this battle. Use [[Protect from Missiles]], if you can not get to the safespot, try using the [[Scarab mage]] or the [[Locust rider]]s as obstacle to avoid melee damage.\n\n'''If you're using Magic''', there is a safespot in the northern part of the cave; so, hide there and use [[Protect from Missiles]]. One may also safespot from the entrance, near Kaleef's corpse. The scarab is particularly weak to [[earth spells]]. However, [[mystic robes]] and the [[Iban Blast]] spell are also ideal; with this setup and the [[protection prayers]], it is an extremely easy fight.\n\nOnce the scarab is defeated, another cutscene will happen where [[Osman]] is miraculously alive (he blended into the shadows). He talks to you then tells you to take the [[Keris]] blade on the floor, and then teleports away.\n\nGo back to the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]]. If you have little food left, teleporting away and coming back via the [[magic carpet]]s may be safer and probably faster than going through the dungeon again. He will confirm that [[Maisa]] was successful and reward you.\n\n'''Congratulations!

You will need to know this in order to identify his grave.\n\nNext, ask him what happened to his head, and he will explain that it got chopped off while he was digging a grave in the [[Haunted Woods]]. You will then ask him to show you where the place was, and he will follow you for ten minutes.\n\nYou can talk to him while in the woods and he will direct you toward his grave. The gardener ghost will stop following you if you wander too far off, log out, teleport, or die. '''Note: you do not need the ghost to be following you in order to find and dig at his grave.'''\n\nHead to the grave pictured. It's located slightly south-east of [[fairy ring]] {{Fairycode|ALQ}}.

You can also use [[Telekinetic Grab]] on the brain that is on the table near the counter. Note that the runes cost more than the 50 coins you would've spent buying it.\n\n===Arms, legs and torso===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Spade]], some [[armour]], [[food]].''\n[[File:Creature of Fenkenstrain - Tomb location.png|thumb|180px|left|The location of the memorial.]]\nUpstairs in [[Fenkenstrain's Castle]], there are bookcases in each the west and the east room. Search the west bookcase for \"The Joy of Grave Digging\" and you will find a [[marble amulet]]. Search the east bookcase for \"Handy Maggot Avoidance Techniques\" and you will find an [[obsidian amulet]]. Use them on each other to get a [[star amulet]].\n[[File:Star amulet detail.png|thumb|The star amulet.]]\nExit [[Fenkenstrain's Castle]], and go east along the path to find some tombstones. Use the [[star amulet]] on the furthest tombstone to the east with the indent on it and push it to enter a dungeon that contains level 25 and 51 [[Experiment]]s. Kill a level 51 [[experiment]] to get a [[cavern key]].\n\nGo through the north-west passage until you reach a gate. Open the door and search the chest before going up the ladder to receive another key to exit, and then dig at the three graves to the north and you get [[legs]], [[arms]], and a [[torso]].\n\n:'''Note:''' Experiments are accessible to train on once you enter the tombstone.\n:Experiments Level 51 are unable to be attacked once you get the key around it's neck.\n\n===Lightning===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Ghostspeak amulet]], [[decapitated head]], [[pickled brain]], [[arms]], [[legs]], [[torso]], [[needle]], 5 [[thread]], 3 [[bronze wire]], [[silver bar]], [[hammer]].''\n[[File:Creature of Fenkenstrain - The Body.png|thumb|200px|The body after all that trouble.]]\nYou are now at the [[Mausoleum]].

He will ask you for a [[needle]] and five spools of [[thread]] to sew the body together. Give them to him to receive yet another assignment. Fenkenstrain notes having a complete body, but with no life within it.\n[[File:Creature of Fenkenstrain - Cleaning the Fireplace.png|thumb|200px|Cleaning the Fireplace.]]\nYou now need to fix the lightning rod so that the castle will get struck by lightning, bringing the monster to life. Ask the [[Gardener Ghost]] for the [[shed key]]. (Notice on some occasions, the ghost doesn't reappear after leading him to the grave near the [[Haunted Woods]]. Re-logging will fix this issue.) The shed is found at the very north end of the castle. Go inside and search the cupboard for the [[garden brush]]. Just east of the shed is a pile of canes. Take three of the\u00a0[[garden cane]]s\u00a0and use them on the brush, and then attach them with [[bronze wire]]\u00a0(you will need 20\u00a0[[Crafting]]\u00a0to do this and the bronze wire will automatically be added to the cane when you use the garden canes on the brush).\u00a0This will create an [[extended brush]], making it suitable for chimney sweeping. Go upstairs and use it on the fireplace in the west room to get a [[conductor mould]]. Make sure you use it on the \"fireplace\" and not the \"fireplace surround.\"\n\nOnce you have the mould, you need to go to a [[furnace]] with a [[silver bar]] in your inventory Use the [[silver bar]] and the [[conductor mould]] on a furnace to make the [[conductor]] (via the 'make lightning rod' option).\n\n:'''Note:''' On some occasions, you will be unable to make the conductor. Re-logging will fix this issue. In some cases you have to talk to the apprentice to get the option to make the conductor in the furnace.\n[[File:Creature of Fenkenstrain - repairing conductor.gif|thumb|160px|The conductor is repaired.]]\nThe nearest furnace is in [[Port Phasmatys]] (2 ecto-tokens needed to enter, free if [[Ghosts Ahoy]] has been completed). Alternatively, one could teleport to [[Falador]] or [[Lumbridge]] to use a [[furnace]], or use the fairy ring (code\u00a0{{fairycode|ALQ}}) south of the [[Haunted Woods]] to teleport to [[Zanaris]], and use the [[furnace]] directly north of the fairy ring. To return, one could use an [[ectophial]], [[Varrock]] teleport, or use the fairy ring.\n\nGo back to [[Fenkenstrain's Castle]]; take the stairs on either the eastern or western side of the castle up to the {{FloorNumber|2}}, walk to the room furthest south, and climb the ladder to the roof. Click on the lightning conductor to fix it. Lightning will instantly strike and the monster comes to life!\n\n===Lord Rologarth===\nTalk to [[Dr. Fenkenstrain]] again. He will tell you that the monster tried to kill him, so he locked it in the tower. He will give you the [[tower key]] and tell you to kill the monster. Go upstairs again, and enter the central room of the upstairs section, climb the ladder, and talk to Fenkenstrain's monster.\n[[File:Creature of Fenkenstrain - He Lives!.png|thumb|200px|It's alive! And, it talks.]]\nThe monster will introduce himself as [[Lord Rologarth]]. He will tell you the true story of how Fenkenstrain tricked him into selling all of his subjects and himself to the [[vampyre]]s, and ask you to stop him from doing anything more. Go back downstairs and pickpocket Fenkenstrain. You need a [[Thieving]] level of 25 to pickpocket Dr. Fenkenstrain to steal his [[ring of charos]] and once done, you will complete the quest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Creature of Fenkenstrain\n|image = [[File:Creature of Fenkenstrain reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*1,000 [[Thieving]] experience\n*The [[Ring of charos]], which allows access to the [[Werewolf Agility Course]], and, when activated during [[Garden of Tranquillity]], reduced cost to many transport links.\n}}\n\n==Note==\nIf you wind the clock in the south-west tower room, you will find a note explaining the history of the castle.\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Creature of Fenkenstrain is required for the following:\n*[[Garden of Tranquillity]]\n*[[The Great Brain Robbery]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*Although not necessary for the completion of this quest, you can find a [[Letter (Creature of Fenkenstrain)|letter]] when winding the clock upstairs in [[Fenkenstrain's Castle]]. This letter, written by [[Lord Rologarth]] (the true owner of the castle), reveals the dark story of [[Dr Fenkenstrain]]'s past.\n*The grave examine reveals a bit of funny wordplay regarding the unlucky gardener's name, \"Here lies Ed Lestwit\".

Ask what you can do to help, then ask ''\"How should I get into the Sanguinesti region?\"'' to initiate the quest. He wants you to make contact with the [[Myreque]] in [[Meiyerditch]].\n*Go southeast to the docks where there is a hut with a boat in it. You will need to repair the boat first, then the wooden slipway (\"boat chute\"), each using a [[plank]] and four [[nails]]. You can now bank or drop your hammer. Push the boat down the chute into the water.\n*Board the boat and travel to [[Meiyerditch]].\n\n===Welcome to Meiyerditch===\n[[File:Floating Vyre.png|thumb|250px]]\n[[File:Darkness of Hallowvale map.png|thumb|250px|A map of Meiyerditch.]]\n*At any stage whilst you are in the open in [[Meiyerditch]], you may be noticed by a member of the [[Vyrewatch]]. Wearing the [[Vyrewatch outfit]] will make it happen less often. When they do, you have three options:\n**Pay a blood tithe (hits 6 [[Hitpoints]]).\n**Get attacked (run away\u2014good if you have lots of [[prayer points]]). The Vyrewatch are invulnerable even against [[Ring of recoil]] and [[poison]].\n**Distract him (doesn't always work and will take a blood tithe if you fail). Success rate depends on [[Thieving]] level. It is a recommended option if you are low on [[Prayer]].\n**Say, \"Send me to the mines!\" This option appears after you've found the [[Myreque hideout]] instead of getting attacked. You need to mine 15 [[Daeyalt ore]]s, then speak to a guard to leave once the mine cart is full. You'll then appear in the north-east part of the city. If you have no [[pickaxe]], a miner will supply one.\n**Don't worry too much about the Vyrewatch\u2014it may pay to take a little [[food]] into the town, but this should be largely unnecessary except for the very lowest level players as they don't get you that often.\n*You arrive at the very southern, damaged end of the wall. Jump over and climb up, then go to where the wall turns north (boards creak). Search the floor (right-click option) and kick the boards in. Climb down into the passage below. \n**This is as far as you need to go to complete the Elite Clue with the coordinates \"00 degrees 35 minutes north 35 degrees 50 minutes east\".\n*Climb over the wall rubble to the north, then head into the town. Talk to any local citizen. Ask them about the Myreque, then whisper that you really need to meet them. They will tell you to speak to [[Old Man Ral]]. Speak to them again and ask if they can introduce you to him. They will tell you to say a friend recommended him.\n*Old Man Ral is a little north-east of the place you enter Meiyerditch. Tell him ''\"Someone said you could help me\"'', and then pick the ''\"Sage of Sanguinesti\"'' option when asked what people are calling him. He should now tell you that you need to get to Sector 3 of the city by following sickle symbols on the walls.\n*Optional: Just to the south, [[Trader Sven]] sells clothing (chat-options 1-2).

Tell him you've come to investigate and he will give you a [[Message (Vertida)|message]] to take to [[Veliaf Hurtz]] back in [[Burgh de Rott]]. \n*Get back to [[Burgh de Rott]] any way you see fit (options see above), and talk to Veliaf Hurtz in the basement of the pub again. ('''Make sure you go through every chat option, or you will be forced to come back to Veliaf'''). He will tell you to talk to [[Drezel]] in the Temple of the Salve in [[Paterdomus]] (the [[Canifis]] [[fairy ring]] ({{fairycode|CKS}}) is a quick way). He will also tell you to speak to [[King Roald]] in [[Varrock Castle]].\n\n===Urgent business===\n[[File:Darkness of Hallowvale - werewolves appear.png|thumb|300px|The player is knocked unconscious by [[shadowy figure]]s.]]\n*Go to [[Drezel]], and talk with him \u2014 he will say that strange noises have been heard outside the temple and would like you to investigate. Climb the ladder in the west room and exit the Temple. To the west of the [[Temple of Saradomin]], look for a bush that is searchable. A short cut-scene will follow where you will be knocked out. You will see [[Shadowy figure|werewolves]] that seem to have managed to get across the [[River Salve]].\n*Return to Drezel, and tell him what you have just seen. He tells you to speak to [[King Roald]] and gives you [[runes]] for a [[Varrock Teleport]].\n*Go to [[Varrock Castle]], and speak with King Roald \u2014 he's on the ground floor on the east side. After a long, fruitless conversation, you will have to return to Drezel. A free teleport back to [[Paterdomus]] is offered by [[Aeonisig Raispher]] if you need it.\n*Speak to Drezel again.\n*Go back to [[Burgh de Rott]], and speak to [[Veliaf Hurtz]] again.\n*Go back to [[Vertida Sefalatis]] in [[Meiyerditch]] via the rooftops as described above or use the\n[[File:doh-mine+lab.png|200px|right|Path to the ladder.]]\n*Alternative way:\n**Speak to a [[Vyrewatch]] and ask to be sent to the mines.\n**Mine 15 Daeyalt ores, once the mine cart is full speak to a guard to leave. If you have no pickaxe, talk to a miner to obtain a bronze one.\n**You will appear up on the surface. On the right is a map of the route to take to get to the hideout; follow the blue path down to the leftmost green dot.\n**From here, follow the old route: Climb up the ladder, jump east to the floorboards, climb down the stairs, and go south-east through the hidden door.\n**This method is faster with a higher level pickaxe such as a [[rune pickaxe]].\n*Once you're down the trapdoor, head over to Vertida again. He will tell you to talk to [[Safalaan]], who is near the castle.\n\n===Scoping Castle Drakan===\n*You can ask Vertida to escort you back to the starting building of the sickle maze. Head south and climb over the wall rubble, and get on top of the wall. Travel as far north on the wall as you can, until you reach a ladder you can go down. Proceed down the ladder.\n*Search the rocky surface (east wall), and the barricade to the north will unlock (this is actually just a part of the wall to the north of where you are standing - NOT a city barricade, like you saw earlier).\n*Open the barricade; then go north, and climb the ladder.\n*Go north along the wall, up a ladder and down one to cross a gap, and keep going north until you see [[Safalaan]]. He will tell you to sketch the castle in three places \u2014 north, then west, then south \u2014 there are sickle symbols on ground to tell you where to sketch. He gives you [[papyrus]] and [[charcoal]] to make the drawings with.\n[[File:Darkness of Hallowvale - the Drakans.png|thumb|250px|Vanstrom meets with the Drakans.]]\n*Travel around the castle to the west (past the sickle), then north (past the sickle), and then east. Make [[Castle sketch 1|a drawing]] here on the sickle symbol on the ground almost directly north of the castle.\n*Go to the west side of the castle and make the [[Castle sketch 2|second sketch]]. You will see a short cutscene, of [[Vanstrom Klause]] talking to Vanescula Drakan and Ranis Drakan.

After a few hits, he will knock you out.\n*You '''WON'T''' be able to defeat Vanstrom, but you '''CAN''' die here, so having 43 [[Prayer]] or some high-healing [[food]] is recommended if your [[Hitpoints]] is around 30 or 40 as Vanstrom can hit a max hit of around 18. Since Vanstrom only attacks you with [[Melee]], using [[Protect from Melee]] or wearing high [[Defence]] [[melee armour]] will work too. You will be knocked out after Vanstrom is unable to kill you.\n*When you recover, speak to Vanescula's servant, [[Sarius Guile]]. She gives you a long-winded hint about where to find a secret laboratory. '''Remember to make your final drawing of the castle before leaving this area! Ensure your quest guide says you have all three map pieces!'''\n\n===The secret laboratory===\n*Return to the Myreque base to the east. To reach the base, follow the directions across the rooftops of the city again. You can return to the mines (and follow the directions above to get to the ladder) instead if you wish. If the Vyrewatches aren't spotting you anymore you can first attempt to take off your citizen/vyrewatch outfit, or else you can try to hop worlds. You may also talk to the Vyrewatches directly and ask to be sent to the mines. [[Safalaan]] is now with [[Vertida Sefalatis]]. Give Safalaan the three drawings of the castle. Now to get the message for Safalaan.\n*Leave the base, go upstairs, jump west, go down the ladder, and exit the house on the northern side. Head to the building with the fireplace just southwest.

He tells you [[troll]]s have taken over the [[Death Plateau (location)|Death Plateau]] and are using it to launch nightly raids. However, they cannot reclaim the camp because the main path is heavily guarded by trolls. It has now become your job to find a different path to the Death Plateau. You also have to open the equipment storage room, which requires a combination code.\n\n===Harold the guard===\n'''''Items required: '''[[Asgarnian ale]], 60+ [[coins]], and a [[Blurberry special]] or [[Premade blurb' sp.]] (optional but recommended).''\n\nTalk to [[Eohric]] on the top floor of [[Burthorpe Castle]]. He will tell you that the guard, [[Harold]], who was on duty is at the [[Toad and Chicken Pub]] in [[Burthorpe]], has the combination. Go to the pub southeast of the castle, and head upstairs and to the left to find him. Try and speak to Harold, but he doesn't want to talk about the combination.\n\nGo back and talk to Eohric. He will tell you that a beer and gambling may help to make Harold get over of his guilt. ''Players '''MUST''' speak to Eohric before proceeding to give the beer to Harold, otherwise the quest will not progress.''\n[[File:Harold dice gamble.png|thumb|right|Gambling dice with [[Harold]].]]\nBuy him an [[Asgarnian ale]], or get one from the table downstairs, and try talking to him again. This time, he will tell you he lost the [[combination]] and that he has searched for it everywhere without any success.\n\n'''Note:''' ''You can ask Harold if he would like another drink and hand over a [[Blurberry special]] or [[Premade blurb' sp.]], which makes Harold drunk and unable to count. This allows you to automatically win all the dice games as Harold believes you are using all four dice.''\n\nNow, ask him if he wants to gamble. Make sure you have a relatively large stack of coins; you have to continue winning the bets until Harold is out of money, and you may lose a few times. Keep trying to beat him until you get an [[IOU]] (you will only get an IOU betting in amounts between 60-1000gp). A somewhat safe method to empty his pockets is to start betting at 100 and then double your bet every loss while going back to 100 after every win. This effectively gives you four chances to win each 100 coin bet. Once you get the IOU, read it to find that the combination code to the storage room is on the back of the [[IOU]]! The [[IOU]] will vanish from your inventory and be replaced with the [[Combination]]. '''Note:''' '''You'll need it at the end but you can get a new IOU (Combination) from Harold if you've lost it.

Talk to the archer there, and he will thank you for getting the combination right and opening the door. '''Make sure you talk to him and not attack him; if you do attack him however, climb down the ladder before heading back up and talk to him again.'''\n\n===The new route===\n'''''Items required:''' 1 free inventory space.''\n[[File:Death_Plateau_Map.png|400px|thumb|The map of [[Death Plateau (location)|Death Plateau]].]]\nWalk out of the [[Burthorpe Castle|castle]] and head north-west, up the path towards [[Death Plateau (location)|Death Plateau]] to find a cave. Go in and talk to [[Saba]]. Ask if he knows of another path to the Death Plateau. The guy has a very rude and grumpy demeanour that may put off anybody, but he hates [[troll]]s as much as those who disturb him, so he will negotiate with you. He proceeds to share with you a secret path from a certain [[Tenzing|Sherpa]]'s house, which leads directly to the Death Plateau.\n\nExit Saba's cave and continue heading west along the path until the path splits into a fork north and south. A wounded soldier marks the dangerous route towards the north. '''<span style=\"color:red\">WARNING:</span>''' '''''If you head north, a warning sign will tell you that Death Plateau is dangerous and you will be attacked by trolls. Do not go this way! Head back south-west.''''' Follow the southern path and enter the house; inside you will find the Sherpa [[Tenzing]]. Talk to Tenzing and ask for his help. He will help you in return for 10 [[Loaf of bread|loaves of bread]], 10 cooked [[trout]] and some [[Spiked boots]]. He will hand you some [[Climbing boots]].\n\n===Spiked boots===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Iron bar]], empty inventory slot and Tenzing's [[climbing boots]].''\n\nTake the [[climbing boots]] to [[Dunstan]] in north-east [[Burthorpe]] (marked by an [[anvil]] on the mini-map, north-east of the castle) to get them changed into [[spiked boots]]. He tells you that he will make you the boots under one condition: His son should be made into an Imperial Guard. He also requires an [[iron bar]] to make the spiked boots.\n\nAfter talking to Dunstan, head back to the tent where you started the quest, and talk to [[Denulth]], and tell him that you have found a new path. However, it will only be revealed under the condition that the [[Tenzing|Sherpa]] has spiked boots and Dunstan's son be put into the Imperial Guard. Denulth makes an exception and gives you a [[certificate]] to accept Dunstan's son into the Imperial troops. Go back to Dunstan, and give him the iron bar and the certificate to receive a pair of [[spiked boots]].\n\n'''Note:''' If you already have a pair of spiked boots in your bank, Dunstan will not make you another pair and just say \"Sorry, I can't do anything with that\" when you try to give him an iron bar, he will also hint that you already own a pair.\n\n===Into the mountains===\n'''''Items required:''' 10 [[Bread|loaves of bread]], 10 [[Trout|cooked trout]], [[combination]], and Tenzing's [[Spiked boots|spiked climbing boots]].''\n\nGo back to [[Tenzing]] and give him his supplies. The bread and trout must be un-[[noted]]!\n\n'''Note:''' ''You must give him the 21 items in one go. [[Trout]] can be bought in the [[Warriors' Guild]].''\n\n[[Tenzing]] gives you a [[secret way map|map of the secret area]]. '''You need to check the path before telling [[Denulth]] about it.''' Exit [[Tenzing]]'s house out the side door to his backyard and climb over the stile. Take the path north and then continue following it east. Keep walking until you pass the second [[Mountain Goat]] and the rocks shortcut (don't try to climb the rocks). You may get a popup message saying that you'll be assailed by trolls if you continue while walking along the secret path. Ignore it, as the trolls will only attack if you're on the normal path. Just keep walking east until you get the message that it's safe to tell [[Denulth]] about the secret path. Return to [[Denulth]] with the [[Combination]] and [[Secret way map|secret map]] in your inventory to complete the quest.

This is a reference to the Cook's Assistant quest.\n*When examining [[Zanik]] at certain points later in the quest, the info \"She's kicking HAM ass\" is given. This caused some anger among players who thought it offensive.\n*When examining [[Zanik]]'s dead body while at [[Juna]], it says \"Alas, poor Zanik.\" referring to a line from Shakespeare's Hamlet: \"Alas, poor Yorick.\"\n*The quest was disabled for a month starting at the launch of the ''[[Old School RuneScape]]'' servers. It is most likely because the quest is involved in a famous graphical glitch, known as \"The box glitch\" in which a player could carry the crate with Zanik in it anywhere.

He is being summoned again, and you have to kill him. Ask her, ''\"So, how did Wally kill the demon?\"'' Write down what [[Wally]] says as it will be important later on. She tells you to talk to [[Sir Prysin]]\u00a0to help. So, go north to [[Varrock Castle]] (Palace), and near the stairs of the castle (first room on the left), Sir Prysin should be walking around.\n\n'''Note that the incantation is random for each player, make sure you write it down.'''\n\nTell Sir Prysin that the Gypsy sent you. Ask for [[Silverlight]], the weapon needed to kill Delrith. He will say that he kept it hidden because of it being so powerful and it needs three keys to open it. Sir Prysin can be found west of where [[King Roald]] is found.\n\n=== Captain Rovin's key ===\nOne of the keys may be obtained by speaking to [[Captain Rovin]], who is found on the {{FloorNumber|3}} on the north west side of the palace. From the room [[Sir Prysin]] is in, walk north until you reach the northwestern staircase, climbing up two stories to reach Captain Rovin.\n\nTell him that you need the key in order to recover [[Silverlight]], as a demon is going to invade the city, and that Sir Prysin mentioned that he would give the key to you. After some arguing, he will reluctantly give you the key, berating Sir Prysin on his clumsiness.\n\n=== Wizard Traiborn's key ===\n'''''Items required:''' 25 unnoted [[bones]].''\n\nTake 25 [[bones]] to the [[Traiborn]]\u00a0located on the {{FloorNumber|2}} of the [[Wizards' Tower]] south of [[Draynor Village]].\u00a0Talk to Wizard Traiborn about the key asking him if he got any keys knocking around, and he will ask for 25 bones. If you have them already, give them to him. If not, get 25 '''regular''' bones (noted bones will not work). One does not need to give [[Traiborn]] all 25 bones at once. Almost every creature in [[Gielinor]] drops bones (if one has low hitpoints or combat level then there is a chicken in the basement of Wizard's Tower). Give him the bones and Traiborn will perform a ritual. When he's done with his ritual, he will give you his key.\n\n===Sir Prysin's key===\n'''''Items required:''' [[bucket of water]].''\n\nHead back to Varrock palace.\n\nGo into the room on the {{FloorNumber|1}} located north-east. It looks like a kitchen. If you do not already have a [[bucket of water]], look for stairs or a ladder that leads up. Go up them, and then go into the room near you to see a [[bucket]]. Grab it. Now, go back down, and in the kitchen, look for a sink (if you cannot find the sink, you can fill the bucket at one of the two fountains near the southern entrance to the [[Varrock Palace|palace]]). Use the bucket with the sink. Now, you will have a bucket of water.\n[[File:Demon Slayer - Sewer map.png|frame|centre|The path to Sir Prysin's key in the sewers]]\nNext, go out the door in the kitchen that leads outside and look for a drain. Use your bucket of water with the drain; '''if you do not do this, you can not obtain the key'''. The second key will have fallen down. Head east out of the palace, and look for a manhole. On your [[minimap]], it will have a red exclamation mark. Climb down the manhole. Now, go north-west and follow a path until you reach a stream. You should see an old rusty key to your left, next to a pile of [[skeleton]]s. Pick it up.\n\n===Banishing Delrith===\nNow that you have all three keys, go back to [[Sir Prysin]] in Varrock. Give him the three keys, and he will give you [[Silverlight]]. Players can drop the Silverlight and ask Sir Prysin for another one for free; after the quest he will charge 500 coins. Make sure that you equip it. Lower-level players may want to get some [[armour]] and [[food]] at this point. \n\n'''Make sure to talk to Gypsy Aris (at her tent in Varrock Square) about the magical incantation to use on Delrith.

Lower-level players should be aware that the wizards are [[aggressive]] to players less than double their level plus an additional level, and use [[magical]] attacks entering the circle for the final part of the quest.\n\nLower levelled players should consider approaching the stone circle from the south rather than from the north, which makes it easier to get Delrith attacking you, and not the wizards. A [[Ring of recoil]] can be used to make the fight easier. Beware, if you die inside the [[instanced]] area, it is not possible to retrieve the items you have lost.\n\nAttack Delrith with Silverlight equipped.

You may attempt the diamonds in any order.\n*:'''Note:''' At some point in the quest, you may be attacked by a level 95 [[Stranger]] who carries a poisoned [[Dragon dagger]].

It is possible to briefly safespot him with Ranged or Magic over the fence near his coffin. Note, however, that he teleports if further than one square away from the player and otherwise at random times. Use Protect from Melee initially and whenever he teleports, and if trying to use this method, Protect from Magic during the brief periods he will be stuck on the fence. This will drastically reduce his damage-per-second if done correctly.\n\n:'''Note:''' [[Cooked karambwan]] can be useful at lower levels since at lower levels, you can find yourself constantly eating, unable to attack.\n\n:'''Note:''' A [[Dwarf multicannon]] can be used to kill [[Dessous]] faster; however, this isn't necessary\u2014you should be fine with just [[prayer potion]]s and food.\n[[File:Graveyard Map.png|thumb|300px|Reaching [[Dessous]] in the [[Morytania Graveyard]].]]\n*Travel to [[Canifis]] ([[Fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|cks}}), and talk to [[Malak]] in the pub telling him that you're looking for a diamond.

Take your [[silver bar]], and go down the trapdoor just east of the bank by the jailhouse to enter [[Draynor Sewers]]. Head north and talk to [[Ruantun]] down here, and he will make you a [[Silver pot (Desert Treasure)|silver pot]].\n*Take the pot to [[Entrana]] (make sure you have no [[weapons]]/[[armour]] on you; if you do, once you reach the ship, use the bank deposit box to bank), and use the silver pot on the [[High Priest]] to get it blessed, in the church.\n*Go back to Canifis, and talk to Malak again. He will fill the pot with blood (your blood!) and damage you for 5 [[Hitpoints]]. You need to use a [[pestle and mortar]] with the garlic if you haven't already and add it to the pot along with some [[spice]]\u2014the [[Ardougne Spice Stall]] is the best place to get this or the [[Grand Exchange]] before going to Dessous.\n*:'''Note:''' If you forgot to bless your pots, the High Priest will still bless it when it is full of blood - although he will be slightly shocked!\n\nThe examine for the pot should read: ''A blessed silver pot filled with blood, garlic and spices.'' If the examine does not say this and you attempt to kill Dessous, he will regenerate to full Hitpoints, and you will need to refill the pot.\n\n{{Gifresize|Dessous spawns.gif|220px|align=right|caption=Dessous comes out of the grave.}}\n*Once you arrive at the [[Graveyard]], pour the blood on the tomb and [[Dessous]] will appear.\n*'''''He teleports making it impossible to safe spot him.'''''\n*''It is however possible to attack him through the fence using range, magic or a''' '''[[halberd]] - simply run behind the fence when he appears and attack. His range and magic defence are much weaker than his melee defence. However, he will teleport next to you at random times, so simply run around the other side of the fence and repeat. This allows you to avoid his strong melee for the majority of the time, and use [[Protect from Magic]] instead. It is also possible to flick protect melee and protect magic/ranged prayer constantly during the fight. That will make him teleport, making it harder for him to hit you.''\n*''If using magic, an easy trick is to simply use no protection prayers and safe-spot Dessous from behind the fence. He will only teleport to you if you're using Protect from Magic, and his magic-based attack is far weaker than his Melee attack.''\n*He uses all three [[attack styles]], so be prepared. Eat food as necessary.\n*:'''Note:''' Using a [[dragon dagger]] is preferable to a [[slash weapon]] due to his low stab defence. It would be wise to bring a [[combat potion]] as well if you decide to melee him.\n*Return to [[Malak]] in [[Canifis]] to claim the [[Blood diamond]]; if the game says Dessous has gotten bored and left when his health has been fully depleted, it means you have defeated him, so don't worry. However, if Dessous disappears before his health has been depleted, or you die or exit the fight early, you will have to make another pot of blood with the spices and garlic and fight him again.\n\n==Ice diamond==\n'''''Items needed for this section:''' Runes for fire spell, [[Cake]] (or chocolate cake), [[Spiked boots]] (made by bringing [[Dunstan]] a pair of [[climbing boots]] and an [[iron bar]]), [[Climbing boots]] (not needed if [[Eadgar's Ruse]] is done and 61 [[Magic]] for [[Trollheim Teleport]]), 3-5 [[Super restore potion]]s or [[Restore potion]] and [[Prayer potion]]s (as '''all''' of your stats will drain due to the bitter cold in the area), [[lobster]]s or better [[food]], ([[Super set]] recommended for [[Melee]] users), and an emergency teleport that doesn't have a Magic requirement, such as the [[Ectophial]] or a [[magic tablet]] for a quick teleport out in case the battle goes south.''\n\n''It is recommended to be on the regular spellbook (instead of lunar or necromancer) in order to cast fire spells.''\n[[File:Ice Path map.png|thumb|200px|After reaching [[Trollheim]], the [[Ice Path]] is due northwest.]]\n:'''Tip:''' The [[Toxic blowpipe]] works wonders\u2014better than Magic and saves inventory space!

When you manage to kill 1 troll, teleport to Clan Wars and run to the portal to fully restore your stats and restock at the bank chest before teleporting back. Repeat this process for each troll you fight, going back to restore stats each time. '''Make sure to bring a chocolate cake.''' \n\n:'''Note:''' If you are using [[Magic]], you are going to need [[runes]] to cast [[Fire spells]] significantly below your level '''Kamil cannot be damaged by any other magics than fire spells''' ([[Fire Bolt]] is recommended since your Magic level will be drained during the coming battles. If you have Fire Bolt, utilise [[Chaos gauntlets]] to increase your maximum hit) and your best magic-based gear to kill multiple enemies as well as [[Kamil]].\n\n*Teleport to [[Trollheim]] (if completed [[Eadgar's Ruse]] and at least 61 Magic; otherwise, use the passage taken in [[Troll Stronghold]]), and then climb down the hill and travel towards the [[Thrower Troll|thrower trolls]]. Run past them with [[Protect from Missiles]]. If you are travelling from the U-shaped cave, you should see a passage to the east. Go down the third passage until you see a troll [[Troll child|child]] standing by an ice gate. This is the entrance to the [[Ice Path]]. It should start to snow as you walk down the passage.\n*Talk to the child, and he will start crying; give him the cake. He will then tell you that his mum and dad have been captured by a bad man.\n*All of your [[Special attack]] energy will be drained as well while in the icy area, so you can use [[Excalibur]] to raise your [[Defence]] briefly before you enter.\n*Enter the ice gate and kill five [[Ice troll|trolls]] (any of those in the area). Once you have killed five trolls at the gate, the cave at the back should open. You can check your progress by examining the cave. It is recommended you go back to the bank and restock your supplies before returning.\n[[File:Kamil safespot.png|thumb|220px|Another player can block [[Kamil]], acting as a [[safespot]] for the attacker.]]\n*Go through the cave at the back and follow the [[Ice Path|path]] round until you come to an open area, where you will find [[Kamil]] - you ought to activate [[Protect from Melee]] to protect against the deadly [[Ice wolf|wolves]] on the path. Once there, attack him with what ever means you have chosen up close, and have the appropriate [[protect prayer]] on at all times. Kamil utilises both Magic and [[Melee]], and it is recommended to use [[Protect from Melee]] as he does significantly more physical damage. His attack, while visibly resembling Ice Barrage, is its own unique spell. While he is casting it, you will be delayed from doing anything for a few seconds and he will hit 1-3 times for a maximum of 5. This delay is even more dramatic if you are [[autocasting]]; using a spell directly from the spellbook will work faster. He dies fairly quickly, but watch your health, your [[prayer points]] and your chosen combat stats.\n*'''Tip: '''The fight is much easier if you protect from melee and when he starts freezing, flick to protect from mage for one tick and back to protect from melee. This will interrupt his freezing and still protect you from the next hit.\n*Once he is dead, you need to follow a very hard to see path. Travel west a little then north, then east, north again until you can go no further, then west and south until you reach the edge of an ice ledge surrounded by ice formations.\n[[File:DT freeing ice trolls.png|thumb|220px|Thawing the ice troll child's parents.]]\n*Put on your [[spiked boots]] and right click the front of the ledge to select \"use ledge\" in order to climb up on the ledge. A long ice path will appear. You might fall as you walk along the ice path and take damage; using your ([[Super restore potion|Super]]) [[restore potion]] to restore your [[Agility]] level will help here. Follow the ice path all the way to the top, through another ice gate. A path will appear after the ice gate as you walk. Continue until you see the troll's parents encased in ice. Attack the cases (they have 10 [[Hitpoints]] each and are easier to melt with Magic) and free the trolls. It's highly advised to bring an extra super restore or two to manage the ice path and to break the parents free from the ice; otherwise, it's very hard to break. After freeing the troll parents, they will take you back outside the gate and give you the [[Ice diamond]].\n*If you are completely out of food when you reach the final ice path, you can use [[Redemption]] (requires 49 [[Prayer]]) to stay alive. Since you only take 1 or 2 damage at a time, this prayer will keep you alive without risk of dying, should you run out of food. However, note that this prayer will drain all your remaining prayer points when its effects are triggered, so it is advised to only use do this if you have several doses of super restores, or [[prayer potion]]s.\n*Because the majority of the damage you will be taking will be dealt by the bitter cold, bringing baskets of strawberries may be a good idea, though it is still necessary to bring enough good food to last in the fight against Kamil.\nAfter completing this section, if you want to save a bit of cash on super restores you can teleport to clan wars using a Ring of Dueling and enter the safe free-for-all portal. This will restore your stats, run energy, and health.\n\n==Smoke diamond==\n[[File:Smoke Dungeon location.png|thumb|200px|The [[Smoke Dungeon|Smokey Well]] is located west of [[Pollnivneach]].]]\n'''''Items needed for this section:''' [[Tinderbox]], [[facemask]] ([[Slayer helmet]] also works), ([[Super energy|Super]]) [[Energy potion|energy]]/[[stamina potion]], [[food]] and [[prayer potion]]s, [[ice gloves]] or [[water spell]] [[runes]], a [[weapon]] (only if wearing [[ice gloves]]), [[armour]] (resistant to [[Magic]] or with [[Prayer bonus]]), 200 [[coins]] and [[Shantay pass]] (if using [[carpet ride]]s), and an emergency teleport.''\n\n:'''Note:''' In case you are using [[Magic]] or [[Ranged]], make sure to use [[Water spells]] or [[ice arrows]].\n\n:'''Note:''' If you do not have [[ice gloves]], you will '''not''' be able to wield a weapon (including bows). The heat will remove your weapon back into your inventory. Bring sufficient [[runes]] without reliance of a staff.\n[[File:Smoke Dungeon map.png|thumb|centre|500px|A map of the [[Smoke Dungeon|dungeon]].]]\n*Take all of the items listed above and travel to the [[Smoke Dungeon|Smokey Well]]. It is marked on the world map; hug the cliffs on the west side of [[Pollnivneach]], and head south to find it.\n[[File:DT torch.png|thumb|220px|The torch the player needs to light.]]\n*Enter the well. In each of the four corners of this dungeon, there are torches that you need to light using your [[tinderbox]]. '''The torches will burn out if you take too long.''' If you walk, the first lamp will burn out by the time you reach the chest. Plan your route through the dungeon first. Run and light all the torches, sipping [[energy potion]]s as you run, and when all four are lit, go to the centre of the dungeon and open the burnt chest that contains a [[Warm key|key]]. You can light all torches in less than two minutes with 1 or 2 doses of a [[stamina potion]].\n*:'''Note:''' It might be best to walk to the northeast torch and light it first, as it's a shorter distance from the southwest torch to the chest.\n*Once you have the key, there's no need to run any more. Stroll to the east part of the dungeon where there is a gate. Use the key with the gate and [[Fareed]] will appear.\n*:'''Note:''' If you are not wearing ice gloves, you will not be able to wield anything in your weapon or shield slot. If you're unable to get ice gloves, it's still possible to kill Fareed by manually casting water spells without a staff; Fareed is very weak to water spells, but they are also the only damaging spells that work against him. (Note that the [[Trident of the seas]] and [[Trident of the swamp|swamp]] '''will not''' work against Fareed.)\n[[File:Fighting Fareed.png|thumb|220px|A player fights [[Fareed]].]]\n*Fareed is relatively easy compared to the other three diamond warriors. Nevertheless, caution is required! If you die after entering Fareed's lair, you will lose your key. If he kills you or you leave the fight, you '''do not''' need to relight the torches and reobtain the key. It is unlikely you will need [[prayer potion]]s at all against him. Simply use the [[Protect from Melee]] prayer, and kill him in whatever way you choose. Protect from Melee is extremely important, however, because his [[Melee]] attacks can hit in the high 30s. Water spells and [[Ice Arrows]] are his main weakness, he is pretty resistant to melee. Magic-resistant armour such as [[Studded leather armour|studded leather]] or [[dragonhide]] will almost completely block out his magic attack. He is weak enough against Melee, but if you're planning on ranging, use ice arrows that are obtained during the [[Temple of Ikov]] quest.\n*Pures should bring runes for the [[Snare]] spell as well as for the water spells and kite Fareed around the large room. Players can cast two or three offensive spells while Fareed is still bound, but should cast snare again immediately after Fareed moves again so as to not get hit with ''immense'' melee damage. Note that Fareed is immune to snares for a few seconds after he breaks free. The snares will bind Fareed ''even if the spell splashes'', but this might be a bug.\n*:'''Note:''' Fareed will leave the fight if you walk too far away from him, so keep him at a safe distance, but not too far.\n*Once he is dead, he will drop the [[Smoke diamond]]. If the Smoke diamond is lost, the diamond will reappear in the chamber on the ground; the player will not have to fight Fareed again.\n\n==Shadow diamond==\n'''''Items required:''' (Suggested gearing after obtaining the cross.) 20 or more [[lockpick]]s (you can bring extra noted lockpicks and coins to exchange bank notes for items at the general store nearby by talking to [[Tiles]]), [[antipoison]]s, [[shark]]s or better [[food]], at least 6 [[prayer potion]]s, [[runes]] to cast spells such as [[Entangle]] and [[Earth Wave]]/Blast, Shantay pass, 2 stamina potions.''\n\n'''''Optional:''' A [[Skills Necklace]] to teleport to the Fishing Guild, [[Dragon dagger (p++)]], and an emergency teleport.''\n\n*Travel west of the [[Fishing Guild]] to where there are several [[moss giant]]s. Just to the north of there, is a fenced area and an NPC called [[Rasolo]] walking around this area. Talk to him, and he says that he will give you a [[ring of visibility]] if you give him a [[gilded cross]].\n*:'''Note:''' [[Rasolo]] needs to be spoken to before you can [[Lockpick|pick-lock]] the chest.\n[[File:DT chest.png|thumb|220px|The chest the player needs to open.]]\n*Take some coins (5000 coins is more than enough), a noted stack of food (do about 10 just to be sure), noted [[antipoison]]s (at least 10) and noted [[lockpicks]] (do at least 20, but more is always better). Lockpicks can be bought from [[Martin Thwait's Lost and Found]] (if you have 50 [[Agility]] and 50 [[Thieving]]). Apart from all the items you have with you in noted form, take also a few pieces of food in un-noted form, one antipoison, and the rest of your inventory with lockpicks. Go to [[Bandit Camp (Kharidian Desert)|Bandit Camp]], which is located south of [[Bedabin Camp]] which you can reach by the magic carpet originating from [[Shantay pass]]. In the most southern tent in Bandit Camp is a Secure Chest. Use your lockpicks on it until you manage to open it and get a gilded cross\u2014this is usually easier said than done. There are three locks, which you must get through, all of which reset themselves if any attempt should fail. Each failure will use up a lockpick and will deal damage. There is also a chance you may be [[poisoned]], so do not underestimate the value of an anti-poison potion or food. If you run out of lockpicks, antipoisons or food, you can un-note your items for a small fee by speaking to [[Tiles]] in the [[general store]] tent. Use the noted form of the items you want to un-note with him.\n*Return to Rasolo, and exchange the gilded cross for the visibility ring.\n*When you wear it, a ladder will appear to the east of him in the fenced area.\n[[File:Shadow Dungeon.png|500px|thumb|center|[[Shadow Dungeon]]]]\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n:#Entrance east of [[Baxtorian Falls]] with [[ring of visibility]]\n:#[[Damis]]\n{{Col-2}}\n:G - [[Giant skeleton (Shadow Dungeon)|Giant skeletons]] ''(level 80)''\n:S - [[Shadow hound]]s ''(level 63)''\n{{Col-end}}\n:'''Note:''' If you plan to use the [[safespot]], lure his first form there. Otherwise, his second form will just disappear into the shadows. '''If you leave after defeating his first form, you do not have to fight it again!''' When you return, you will only have to defeat his second form.\n::\n*When you climb down the ladder, head east as far as you can, then north as far as you can. Head east, and go south as far as possible at the first option. Go east again. You will see a little cave to your south as you go past. If you run into this, you can recharge [[Hitpoints]] and [[run energy]] without using vital supplies. After this, take the next turn north, then go east, and you will reach [[Damis]]' cave. Activate [[Protect from Melee]] to ward off the [[giant skeleton (Shadow Dungeon)|giant skeletons]] and [[shadow hound]]s since this is a [[multi-combat area]]. Run around for a while, and he'll appear.\n*Attack and kill Damis' first form, which is level 103 and only attacks with [[Melee]] and is fairly easy to beat.\n*He will then change to his second form, which is level 174 and rapidly drains [[Prayer]] (at a rate of 4-5 points per second). This form is significantly harder.\n*There are several tried and tested methods for fighting the second form of Damis, and a few will be listed here. See which one looks best for you and try it. Whichever method you choose, he will drop the [[Shadow diamond]] after you defeat him.\n*Players who wish to complete the [[Kandarin Diary]] are advised to kill a Shadow Hound while in the dungeon, as it is a hard task.\n\n====Method one====\n[[File:Fighting Damis.png|thumb|220px|A player fights [[Damis]].]]\n'''Combat style:''' [[Magic]]\n\n'''Inventory:''' [[Runes]] ([[Nature rune|nature]], [[Earth rune|earth]], [[Water rune|water]], [[Blood rune|blood]]/[[Death rune|death]], and [[Air rune|air]]). A one-click teleport (like the [[Ectophial]]), fill your inventory with as many [[Prayer potion|prayer potions (4)]] as possible (bring at least 8), and just a few [[shark]]s or better food. You will rely heavily on [[Protect from Melee]], otherwise without it activated, you will die quickly because you will be tanking 2-4 [[giant skeleton (Shadow Dungeon)|giant skeletons]] and [[shadow hound]]s while trying to kill [[Damis]]. You will need to click on a [[prayer potion]], to drink a dose, every 4\u20135 seconds. To make this much more effective, wait until having only about 5 prayer points left to drink another dose of potion. This is effective because prayer points are drained based on percentage.\n\n'''Optional:''' A couple of [[super energy]] potions to be used for shortening the journey through the maze.\n\n'''Tactic:''' This is basically making [[Damis]] into a regular fight, just a bit harder. If you have ever fought another creature that only uses Melee with [[Prayer]], this is basically the same only you will be using more potions. Use Magic spells, and kill him quickly. It is possible to use Melee or Ranged, but he is weak to Magic and incredibly strong against Melee, so it is not recommended. While fighting or even initially, cast [[Snare]]/[[Entangle]] on [[Damis]], once he moves, re-cast Snare/Entangle.\n\n'''Note: Damis is not particularly weak to earth spells.  This was confirmed by Mod Ash.'''<ref>https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1028980496020242432</ref>\n\nYou can also use a [[Trident of the seas]] for both forms.\n\nAdditionally, Damis only appears to drain Prayer when he is within a few tiles of you. Bringing a [[stamina potion]]'' ''and kiting him around the arena will help reduce the burden of using [[Prayer potion]]s.\n\n====Method two (not recommended)====\n'''Combat style:''' [[Melee]]\n\n'''Inventory:''' A [[dragon dagger]] (poison necessary), a one-click teleport (like the [[Ectophial]]), a few [[prayer potion]]s, and the rest of your inventory full of [[shark]]s or better food.\n\n'''Optional:''' A couple of [[super energy potion]]s to be used for shortening the journey through the maze.\n\n'''Tactic:''' As soon as you see [[Damis]], put on the [[Protect from Melee]] prayer, and use all of your [[Dragon dagger (p++)]] [[special attack]]s on him. This will lower his health and poison him, but it's the poison that is most important. As soon as you have done this, run into the safe room to the northwest. Hide in there until you can see that his poison damage is as low as 2, and hit him with another 4 specials. Repeat until he is dead.\n\n====Method three (not recommended)====\n'''Combat style:''' [[Magic]]/[[Ranged]]\n\n'''Inventory:''' [[Runes]] ([[Nature rune|nature]], [[Earth rune|earth]], [[Water rune|water]], [[Blood rune|blood]]/[[Death rune|death]], and [[Air rune|air]]), a one-click teleport (like the [[Ectophial]]), and the rest of the space divided between [[prayer potion]]s and [[shark]]s.\n\n'''Optional:''' A couple of [[super energy potion]]s to be used for shortening the journey through the maze.\n[[File:Desert treasure safespot.png|thumb|220px|A player uses a [[giant rat]] to [[safespot]] [[Damis]].]]\n'''Tactic:''' Once you encounter [[Damis]], activate your [[Protect from Melee]] prayer. Once you have done that, exit out the way you came, and go south, then head towards east. From there, you should see a [[giant rat]]. There's also another rat roaming around a passage northwest of the area where Damis appears. Either way, position yourself behind the rat, and you can attack it with a weak attack or spell, and Damis can be attacked with Magic without you being harmed. This also works with the small [[bat]] found in the southwest corner of the arena from which you entered. Consider bringing a fun weapon such as flowers to draw its attention without killing it.\n\n==Jaldraocht pyramid==\n'''''Items required:''' [[Smoke diamond]], [[Shadow diamond]], [[Blood diamond]], [[Ice diamond]]''\n\n'''''Recommended items:''' [[Prayer items|Prayer point-boosting equipment]], [[Holy wrench]], [[Weight-reducing equipment]] (such as [[Graceful clothing]]), 2+ [[Prayer potion]]s, 1 [[Super antipoison]] (or some [[strange fruit]]), Some [[energy potion]]s or one [[Stamina potion(4)]], [[Waterskin]](s), [[Shantay pass]], Some [[food]]\u2014[[Cooked sweetcorn]] is recommended as it has no weight., Emergency teleport for low level players if you run out of prayer potions and/or food.''\n\n===Pyramid===\n[[File:Pillar.png|thumb|220px|The pillar absorbs the gem.]]\nReturn to [[Eblis]] at the six mirrors in the desert. Be sure to have the four diamonds in your inventory. Go to [[Jaldraocht Pyramid|the Pyramid]] southeast of Eblis (marked \"Pyramid\" on the world map), and place one diamond in each of the four obelisks at the outside corners of the pyramid. Each obelisk takes a specific diamond. You should be able to determine the diamond from the appearance of the obelisk, but trial-and-error placement also works. It is not possible to put a diamond into the wrong obelisk; it is also not possible to take a diamond back out of the obelisk.\n\nWhen all four obelisks are activated, the pyramid will open and can be entered from the top.\n\n===Tomb raider===\n[[Desert heat]] is not a factor inside the pyramid, but almost all of the interior is dangerous, with level 124 [[scarab swarm]]s occasionally boiling out of the floor, and level 110 [[mummies]] roaming about and spontaneously popping out of sarcophagi. All monsters use only [[Melee]], though the scarab swarms can also [[poison]]. The scarab swarms, spontaneous mummies, and traps cannot be detected in advance. The room containing the altar on Level 4, however, is safe.\n\nEvery time a scarab swarm appears or a mummy pops out of a sarcophagus, you will stop moving, and will not be able to move until the animation has finished. It is possible to avoid a scarab swarm entirely by making sure it is behind a mummy. There are also randomly activated traps that will send you back to the entrance of the pyramid. By bringing [[weight-reducing clothing]] and plenty of [[super energy potion]]s or [[stamina potion]]s, you can greatly reduce the chance of running into one of these traps. If you get caught by a trap, you will be taken outside to the south side of the pyramid but with no damage done. Do not click directly to the ladder but keep clicking to your goal as this will reduce the chances of getting caught by traps. Just walk north and re-enter the pyramid to start over. It is useful to use a [[strange fruit]] while inside the pyramid due to the fact that it recovers 30% run energy and cures any kind of poison you may have gotten while inside the pyramid.\n\n''The levels in the pyramid are numbered in the order the player encounters them in the quest. The purple line marks the route.''\n\n====Outside====\nEnter the pyramid from its top. The southern entrance to Level 4 and the [[Ancient Magicks]] altar can only be used after the quest has been completed.\n[[File:Jaldraocht outside.png|centre|Diagram of the pyramid's exterior]]\n\n====Level 1====\nRun from the entrance ladder to the Level 2 ladder. This level is the smallest in the area, with the fewest mummies. If possible, flick your prayer and save your run energy.\n[[File:Jaldraocht level 1.png|centre|Level 1 of Jaldraocht]]\n\n====Level 2====\nRun from the Level 2 ladder to the Level 3 ladder. This level is the second smallest in area, with a few more mummies roaming about. This room might have a few traps. Be sure to look out for them.\n[[File:Jaldraocht level 2.png|centre|Level 2 of Jaldraocht]]\n\n====Level 3====\nRun from the Level 3 ladder to the Level 4 ladder. This level is fairly large in area, presenting more of a challenge to players traversing it. A significant number of mummies are roaming about, and there is a vast amount of traps.\n[[File:Jaldraocht level 3.png|centre|Level 3 of Jaldraocht]]\n\n====Level 4====\nRun from the Level 3 ladder to the altar room. This level is quite large in area, with a lot of mummies roaming about everywhere except the altar room. The altar room is separated by a door\u2014do not rely on the minimap to run outside.\n[[File:Jaldraocht level 4.png|centre|Level 4 of Jaldraocht]]\n:''Easy tip to remember which way to start running after each level:'' North, East, South, West.\n\n===Azzanadra===\n[[File:Azzanadra chathead.png|left]]\n[[File:Azzanadra.png|thumb|120px|Azzanadra.]]\nIt is possible for a [[scarab swarm]] to boil up inside the altar room, but this only happens if it was boiling up as you were entering the room. If this is the case, trap it between the door and an obstacle that is just in front of the door. Speak to [[Azzanadra]], who has lost track of time and believes that the [[God Wars]] are still going on. He goes on to talk about some ancient unknown civilisations like [[Edgeville|Paddewwa]], [[Ice Mountain|Lassar]] and [[Demonic Ruins|Annakarl]]. He is also surprised to see that he cannot hear [[Zaros]] in his mind anymore.\n\nAzzanadra, finally coming to peace with the reality, rewards the adventurer with the [[Ancient Magicks]] of Zaros, for their efforts.

You can use the [[balloon transport system]] to fly back to the earth altar by using a set of [[willow logs]], if you have already unlocked the [[Varrock]] destination, and ten sets if not.\n\n===A gift for Entrana===\n'''''Items required:''' The [[bow-sword]] and a [[large pouch]].''\n\nGive the [[bow-sword]] to the Monk and he will be grateful for it; although he needs one more favour. A special ceremony is to be held on the island of [[Entrana]], though unfortunately the monk cannot attend it and he wants to give them a special present to mark the occasion.\n\nHe gives you an [[Orb (Devious Minds)|orb]] to deliver to the church in Entrana. But for the surprise to work, you must sneak into the church and not be seen entering the island. He advises using the realm of the [[Abyss]] to get to the [[law altar]] on Entrana; he also wants you to keep the orb in a vessel from the realm to avoid it from being damaged. To do this, hide the orb in a [[large pouch]] - thus creating an [[Large pouch (Devious Minds)|illuminated large pouch]].\n[[File:Large pouch detail.png|right]]\nLarge pouches can only be obtained from [[abyssal leech]]es, [[abyssal guardian|guardians]] and [[abyssal walker|walkers]] found within the [[Abyss]]. In addition, the pouch is only dropped if you have all the pouches below it. You do not need to have the [[Runecrafting]] level (50) in order for it to be dropped, but it is required to use it.\n:'''Please Note:''' The ''only possible way'' to get to Entrana with the orb is through the Abyss. If you try the balloons, or [[Port Sarim]], you will be cut off when the monks or balloon assistant asks about the 'pouch and its contents'.\n\nAs usual, no other [[weapons]] or [[armour]] are allowed on Entrana, so bank them before entering the Abyss. The Abyss is accessible only through a teleport from the [[Mage of Zamorak]], who is located in the [[Wilderness]] at the point where the [[River Lum]] goes underground, just north of [[Edgeville]]. Enter the Abyss to reach the law altar, and through it, Entrana.\n\n''If your pouch is degraded, you will be denied access into Entrana with the orb in it.

It turns out that the orb you delivered was in fact a teleportation item using ancient magic, which allowed the assassin to sneak into the holy island, unhindered.\n\nAfter the cutscene, talk to the [[High Priest (Entrana)|High Priest]], who'll forgive for it not being your fault and tells you to return to the monk at [[Paterdomus]] to investigate.\n[[File:Deadmonk.png|thumb|220px|The dead monk at Paterdomus.]]\nOn arriving back at the Paterdomus temple, you see the [[Monk (Devious Minds)|monk]] you helped is gone, replaced by a [[Dead Monk]].

Upon hearing about the strange events, he asks you to contact [[Sir Tiffy Cashien]] at the [[Falador]] park.

He will then tell you to visit [[Oziach]], who is located in the north-west corner of [[Edgeville]], very close to the [[Wilderness]]. Oziach says that to be able to buy a [[rune platebody]] from him, you have to kill the [[green dragon]], [[Elvarg]], located on the desolate island of [[Crandor]].\n\nReturn to the Champions' Guild, and talk to the Guildmaster again. He will be shocked and will tell you that you will need to obtain three pieces of the map to get to the island, a boat to reach Crandor, and a shield to protect yourself from the dragon's fire.\n:'''Important:''' You '''must ask him every question''' you can; otherwise, you won't be able to progress in the quest.\n\nAsk him where [[Melzar]]'s piece is to obtain the [[maze key]] ('''must''' have open inventory slot), and make sure you ask him where the maps are and where to get an [[anti-dragon shield]].\n:'''Note:''' To save time, make sure you talk to the Guildmaster about buying a boat (ask how you can get to Crandor and where to get a ship) before you go see [[Klarense]] in [[Port Sarim]] later in the quest. This will save you having to walk back to the Guild after collecting the map.\n\n=== Obtaining the anti-dragon shield ===\nA free [[Anti-dragon shield]] may be obtained by speaking to [[Duke Horacio]] in [[Lumbridge]]. He is located on the {{FloorNumber|2}} floor of the castle, in the northern room. Alternately, you may purchase a shield from the [[Grand exchange]] very cheaply.\n\n===Obtaining the map pieces===\nThese map pieces may be obtained in any order. When you have all three, use any piece on another piece to form the complete [[Crandor map]].\n\n====Melzar's map piece====\n{{Main|Melzar's Maze}}'''''Items required:''' The [[Maze key]], [[food]] and [[combat]] [[equipment]]. (The most difficult enemy is the [[lesser demon]]; you can [[safespot]] it with [[Magic]]/[[Ranged]] and with [[melee]] as well.)''\n[[File:Dragon Slayer - Melzar's Maze.png|frame|[[Melzar's Maze]]]]\n[[File:Dragon Slayer - Lesser demon safe spot.png|thumb|220px|The [[lesser demon]] in [[Melzar's Maze]] can be safe spotted using [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]].]]\nThe first piece is found in [[Melzar's Maze]]. You will need food if you have a low [[combat level]]. Melzar's Maze can be found north-west of [[Rimmington]], south of the [[Crafting Guild]], and west of [[Port Sarim]]. (If your [[house portal]] is located here, you may wish to teleport to house and exit portal.) To get inside of Melzar's Maze, you must use the [[Maze key|key]] you get from the [[Guildmaster]] in the [[Champions' Guild]] when you've started the quest. Once inside Melzar's Maze, do the following:\n#Kill the small [[zombie rat]] with a long tail to get a [[red key]]. Once you have the red key,\u00a0use it on\u00a0the door that is most north (the room has a bookcase, poster, table and chairs in it),\u00a0and go up the ladder.\n#You will find yourself in a room full of [[ghost]]s; kill the hooded ghost wearing a tube top and without a cape to receive an [[orange key]]. To the east of the ladder that you came up, go through the second door from the north, and go up the ladder.\n#You will find yourself in a room full of [[skeleton]]s. Kill the skeletons with small, round shields until you get a [[yellow key]];\u00a0open the southwestern door, and go down the ladder at the end of the room.\n#Go down the ladder again, and again, until you find yourself in a room with two [[Zombie (common)|zombies]] and a blue door. Don't use the normal exit door. If by chance you exit through the normal door, you will have to start the maze over again. Kill the zombies until you get a\u00a0[[blue key]].\u00a0Use the key on the blue door to get to the next room.\n#In this room, you will need to kill [[Melzar the Mad]] (level 43). For lower level [[mage]]s or [[ranged|rangers]], it might be possible to trap a [[spider]] between you and [[Melzar]], preventing him from using his [[Melee]] attack, which causes him to do nothing for long periods of time during the fight. After you have killed him, pick up his\u00a0[[magenta key]], and use it to open the\u00a0magenta door.[[File:Dragon Slayer - Lesser demon melee flinch safe spot.gif|thumb|220px]]\n#In this room, there is a [[lesser demon]] (level 82). There is a [[safespot]] for rangers/mages and for meleers as well. For mages and rangers, stand one square to the right of the magenta door when looking north (this spot can also be used with a halberd). For meleers, lure the demon to the western part of the room, and attack it at his maximum attack range then walk one square west to make it lose interest, repeating that strategy as many times as needed (see gif to the right). Kill it to get a [[green key]]; use this key on the\u00a0green door then '''open and search the chest to get a\u00a0map part.'''\n#Go up the ladder, and exit through the doors.\n\n====Thalzar's map piece====\n'''''Items required:''' An [[unfired bowl]], a [[wizard's mind bomb]], a [[lobster pot]], and [[silk]].''\n[[File:Dwarven Mine map.png|200px|thumb|[[Dwarven Mine]]]]\nTo obtain this piece, you'll need an [[unfired bowl]], created in the [[Crafting]] skill, a [[Wizard's mind bomb]], which can be bought in [[Falador]] for 3 [[coins]], a [[lobster pot]], which can be bought in [[Port Sarim]] for 20 coins, and a piece of [[silk]], which can be bought in [[Al Kharid]] or stolen from a [[silk stall]] with level 20 [[Thieving]]. When you have all these items, talk to the [[Oracle]], who is located on the northern end of [[Ice Mountain]].\n\nThen, when the Oracle is done talking, go into the [[Dwarven Mine]] with all those items. Look for a magic door in the northeastern part of the mines. It is just before you see [[scorpion]]s. When you've found it, you must use all of your items on the door to open it. Open the chest and search for the second map piece.\n:'''Note:''' Placing the wrong items into the door or putting some in, leaving, then coming back, and putting in the rest of the items will not cancel out the items already placed in the door. '''Be careful not to left click your Wizard's Mind Bomb, as you will consume it rather than use it.'''\n\n====Lozar's map piece====\n'''''Items required:''' 10,000 [[coins]] '''or''' [[Ranged]]/[[Magic]] [[combat equipment]], an [[air rune]] and a [[law rune]] (33+ [[Magic]] required).''\n[[File:Port Sarim Jail.png|thumb|200px|Port Sarim Jail]]\nThe third and final piece can be obtained by talking to [[Wormbrain]]. You must first make your way to the Goblin Village and talk to the General who will tell you that Wormbrain has been arrested and is located in the jail in Port Sarim. Use one of two different ways to get the map piece from\u00a0Wormbrain,\u00a0located in [[Port Sarim Jail]].\n*You can attack him using [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]. Once his health reaches zero, he will say \"Ow!\" and drop the map part for you to [[telegrab]] (if you bought an extra [[Wizard's Mind Bomb]], you can drink it to boost your Magic level +2).\n*Wormbrain can be attacked and will drop his map piece whether the player has spoken to the Goblin General or not. \n*Alternatively, you can pay him 10,000 [[coins]] in exchange for it.\n\nWith all three map pieces, simply use two together, and they will all combine into the [[Crandor map|treasure map]].\n\n===Obtaining a boat===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[hammer]], the [[Crandor map]], 90 [[steel nails]], 3 [[plank]]s, and 2,000 [[coins]].''\n[[File:Dragon Slayer - Crandor map.png|thumb|220px|Crandor Map with all 3 pieces combined.]]\n:'''Note:''' You will need to talk to the [[Guildmaster]] about buying a boat before you go see [[Klarense]], but only if you haven't asked him already.\n\nYou will need\u00a090\u00a0[[steel nails]]\u00a0and three [[plank]]s. To obtain the steel nails, you can either\u00a0[[Smithing|smith]] six\u00a0[[steel bar]]s\u00a0into nails (requires level 34 Smithing, which is boostable), or you can buy them from the [[Sawmill operator]]\u00a0north-east of [[Varrock]]\u00a0or from other players. If you are a free to play ironman, the only place to get planks is at the [[Graveyard of Shadows]] in level 19 Wilderness. Next, get a [[hammer]] and 2,000 [[coins]]. Go to [[Port Sarim]] and look for [[Klarense]], a sailor. He is located on the second-most southern dock. He will sell you his boat named [[Lady Lumbridge]] for 2,000 coins. Pay him the 2,000 coins, and the boat is now yours. Go on the ship and go inside it. Repair the hole in the ship by using the planks with the hole.\n:'''Note:''' If you forgot your hammer, and are on a [[members]]' world, you can buy one from a [[Trader Crewmember]] on the dock to the south, travel to the [[Void Knights' Outpost]] and buy one from the general store, or you can attack the [[goblins]] to the west until one is dropped. If you are on a free world you can kill goblins west of [[Port Sarim]] until they drop a [[hammer]].\n\nDo this three times, and the hole will be repaired. Next, go to [[Draynor Village]] and find [[Ned]], the person who makes [[rope]]s for you. Ask him to be the captain and help sail you to [[Crandor]]. Make sure you have the [[Crandor map]] in your inventory, or you will need to retrieve it from your bank. He will agree and tell you to meet him on your ship.\n\n===The fight===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Food]], [[combat]] [[equipment]] and the [[anti-dragon shield]].''\n[[File:Crandor (island) map.png|thumb|200px]]\nNow, it is time to prepare. Equip the [[Anti-dragon shield]], some [[armour]], and a [[weapon]]. [[Elvarg]] is weak against [[Stab weapons|stab attacks]], so consider bringing a sword or dagger instead of a scimitar. Adamant or better is recommended. Elvarg is also weak against [[Ranged Attack]], so Rangers should bring their best [[crossbow (weapon)|crossbow]] with the best [[bolts]] they can use. Elvarg is not immune to [[poison]], so adding\u00a0[[weapon poison]] will make the battle go much smoother, thus a p++ dagger would be superb.\u00a0The rest of your inventory should be filled with food; [[lobster]]s or [[swordfish]] should do. Swordfish are preferable to lobsters since they heal more per bite (14 vs 12), but with a [[combat level]] of around 40 and appropriate gear, you should be able to easily defeat Elvarg with just lobsters. If your stats are lower, you can buy or cook\u00a0[[meat pizza]]s or [[anchovy pizza]]s\u00a0with level 45 [[Cooking]]\u00a0to bring as they heal more [[Hitpoints]] per inventory slot, but require a second bite to consume. A meat pizza heals 8 HP per bite (16 total) while an anchovy pizza heals 9 per bite (18 total).\n[[File:Dragon Slayer - Cabin boy Jenkins fried.png|thumb|220px|A reason why good defence and dragonfire protection is needed to face Elvarg.]]\nGo to your ship and sail to the island [[Crandor]]. After crashing on the island, make your way through the island to the top, avoiding the monsters there. You'll see stairs behind some [[lesser demon]]s. Run past them, and enter the hole. You'll be in a cave surrounded by [[skeletons]]. Keep walking and you'll see Elvarg behind a door in a room.\n\nBefore you enter the room, make sure that your anti-dragon shield is equipped. Also, if you go south a little further past the lesser demons, you should see a wall with an open option. Push it to go through and unlock a shortcut back to Elvarg in the event that you die or teleport away. Now, go in and fight Elvarg.\n\n====Battle strategies====\n'''Note:''' You can return and continue the fight if you die, as well as pick up your items. But when returning you can use the [[amulet of glory]] to Karamja and go down the volcano to return to Elvarg quickly, If you have opened the secret door before the fight. If not you must refix the boat and return with Ned again.\n[[File:Dragon Slayer - Fighting Elvarg.png|thumb|300px|A player battles against Elvarg, the destroyer of Crandor.]]\nConsider having [[Protect from Magic]] activated, as [[Elvarg]]'s [[Fire Blast]]-like magical attacks hit high. Again, using a [[stab weapon]] like a [[dragon dagger (p++)]] is a good idea since [[Dragon (race)|dragons]] are weak to stab. If you also use [[Ranged]] on the dragon, make sure you are using a one-handed weapon such as a [[crossbow (weapon)|crossbow]], unlike a [[bow]], which is two-handed. With a crossbow, you are still able to equip the [[anti-dragon shield]] necessary in the quest.\n\nIf you are using magical attacks, make sure you are using tier-2 [[Magic]] (i.e. [[Bolt spells]] such as [[Wind Bolt]], [[Water Bolt]], etc.) or higher and can equip the anti-dragon shield. Also, bring [[teleportation]] [[runes]] just in case you are about to die.\n\nIt is important to note that if you use an anti-dragon shield, as well as a drinking a dose of [[antifire potion]], Elvarg can only hit a maximum of 7 (3 or 4 if combined with Protect from Magic) with her magical attack instead of 11, thus saving you a lot of food.\n\nIf you are around 35 [[Defence]], or more, it may be advised to stand next to Elvarg, rather than [[safespotting]], as her mage hits can easily outweigh her [[melee]] hits. It is also advised to stand under her while you eat, as it will save food by not getting hit whilst you can't hit.\n\nLower levels and [[iron men]] without antifire potions are advised to use a [[ring of recoil]], as Elvarg's fast hits make it particularly useful in dealing back damage.\n\nAlso, Elvarg can be flinched using melee attacks. This is fairly easy for players who know and practiced [[flinching]] before, to the point where it takes almost no food to kill her. For players who don't know what flinching is, it is still recommended to take a lot of food, as getting her in the right position is quite tricky. You need to stand in the southeastern corner of her cave, in the square directly next to the top-left corner of the little lava pool, and you need to get Elvarg to stand directly left of the skeleton on the ground to the northwest. If you pull this off, you will notice she does not use melee or magic attacks, while you're standing on the square mentioned above. From there, you simply attack her, and immediately click on the top-left corner of the little lava pool again to walk back to the safe square (as there are often rats occupying the actual square). Wait for her health-bar to disappear and repeat the process. As this can and will still go wrong every now and then, it is still recommended, but not strictly necessary, to bring food and have a decent combat stat (30+).\n\nIf you die or teleport away, you will need to repair the boat again, unless you open the shortcut. If you did open the shortcut, you will not be able to travel to Crandor again by boat. You must use the entrance underneath [[Karamja Volcano]].\n\nIf you happen to teleport away, Elvarg will not heal if you go back quick enough. So, if you get her down low enough and leave, she will still be injured, making her much easier to kill the second time around.\n\n===Finishing up===\n[[File:Dragon Slayer - Elvarg slain.png|thumb|250px|A player beheads Elvarg]]\nOnce [[Elvarg]] is defeated and you have triumphed, you will automatically collect\u00a0[[Elvarg's head]] (make sure you have an empty inventory slot). Either teleport out, or go through the shortcut and past the [[deadly red spider]]s, to the south east of the dungeon where the skeletons are, and climb up the hanging rope to arrive on top of Karamja volcano. From here, journey to [[Edgeville]], straight to\u00a0[[Oziach]]\u00a0with Elvarg's head in order to prove your feat (although the head is not required in order to complete the quest).\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|image = [[File:Dragon Slayer reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|name = Dragon Slayer\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = *{{Skill clickpic|Strength|18,650}} [[Strength]] [[experience]]\n*{{Skill clickpic|Defence|18,650}} [[Defence]] experience\n*The ability to equip a [[green d'hide body]], [[rune platebody]], and [[dragon platebody]]\n*Access to [[Crandor]]\n*Access to the [[Corsair Cove Resource Area]]\n*Ability to use equipment that protects against [[dragonfire]]\n}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*When speaking to Oziach at the start of the quest, he asks you how you found out he sells the rune platebody.

The Crandor we know today is very different from that of the past and there are so many questions that remain unanswered - your chance to uncover the secrets of the past starts with Dragon Slayer II.\n|length = Very Long\n|requirements = *{{Skill clickpic|Quest|200}} [[Quest points]]\n*Completion of the following quests:\n**[[Legends' Quest]]\n***[[Family Crest]]\n***[[Heroes' Quest]]\n****[[Shield of Arrav]]\n****[[Lost City]]\n****[[Merlin's Crystal]]\n****[[Dragon Slayer]]\n****[[Druidic Ritual]]\n***[[Underground Pass]]\n****[[Biohazard]]\n*****[[Plague City]]\n**[[Dream Mentor]]\n***[[Lunar Diplomacy]]\n****[[The Fremennik Trials]]\n****[[Lost City]]\n****[[Rune Mysteries]]\n****[[Shilo Village]]\n*****[[Jungle Potion]]\n***[[Eadgar's Ruse]]\n****[[Druidic Ritual]]\n****[[Troll Stronghold]]\n*****[[Death Plateau]]\n**[[A Tail of Two Cats]]\n***[[Icthlarin's Little Helper]]\n****[[Gertrude's Cat]]\n**[[Animal Magnetism]]\n***[[Ernest the Chicken]]\n***[[Priest in Peril]]\n***[[The Restless Ghost]]\n**[[Ghosts Ahoy]]\n***[[Priest in Peril]]\n***[[The Restless Ghost]]\n**[[Bone Voyage]]\n***[[The Dig Site]]\n***100 [[Kudos]]\n**[[Client of Kourend]]\n'''No boosts allowed:'''\n*{{Skill clickpic|Magic|75}} [[Magic]]\n*{{Skill clickpic|Smithing|70}} [[Smithing]]\n*{{Skill clickpic|Mining|68}} [[Mining]]\n*{{Skill clickpic|Crafting|62}} [[Crafting]] \n*{{Skill clickpic|Agility|60}} [[Agility]] (higher recommended)\n*{{Skill clickpic|Thieving|60}} [[Thieving]] (higher recommended)\n*{{Skill clickpic|Construction|50}} [[Construction]]\n*{{Skill clickpic|Hitpoints|50}} [[Hitpoints]]\n\n*Started the [[Firemaking]] part of [[Barbarian Training]] to gain access to the [[Ancient Cavern]]\n|items =\n*A [[pickaxe]]\n*An [[axe]]\n* 8 [[oak plank]]s\n* 10 [[swamp paste]]\n* At least 12 [[nail]]s of any kind ('''Note:''' Bringing more is recommended; nails may bend!)\n* A [[hammer]]\n* A [[machete]]\n* A [[saw]]\n* [[Catspeak amulet]]\n* [[Ghostspeak amulet]]\n* [[Goutweed]]\n* [[Cut dragonstone]]\n* 2 [[molten glass]]\n* [[Glassblowing pipe]]\n* [[Spade]]\n* [[Astral rune]]\n*[[Seal of passage]] (if elite [[Fremennik Diary]] is not done)\n*[[Tinderbox]]\n* [[Pestle and mortar]]\n*Runes for 3 [[Fire Wave]] spells OR 3 [[Fire Surge]] spells\n'''Recommended:'''\n* [[Stamina potion]]s\n* [[Serpentine helm]] or [[anti-venom+]]\n* Teleports to various places around the game, most notably [[Musa Point]], [[Fossil Island]], [[Lunar Isle]], and [[Rellekka]]\n* High-tier [[combat]] equipment, high-healing [[food]], and [[prayer potions]]\n|kills = * [[Vorkath]] ''(level 392)''\n* [[Spawn (Dragon Slayer 2)|Spawn]] ''(level 100)''\n* [[Robert the Strong]] '' (level 194) ''\n* 2 [[Green dragon]] ''(level 79)''\n* 2 [[Blue dragon]] ''(level 111)''\n* [[Red dragon]] ''(level 152)''\n* [[Iron dragon]] ''(level 189)''\n* [[Brutal green dragon]] ''(level 227)''\n* [[Black dragon]] ''(level 227)''\n* [[Steel dragon]] ''(level 246)''\n* [[Brutal red dragon]] ''(level 289)''\n* [[Mithril dragon]] ''(level 304)''\n* [[Adamant dragon]] ''(level 338)''\n* [[Rune dragon]] ''(level 380)''\n* [[Galvek]] ''(level 608)''}}\n\n==Starting off==\n''Items required: [[Pickaxe]] (suggested: [[Amulet of glory]], [[Digsite pendant]], [[weapons]] and [[armour]])''\n\nTo start the quest, first speak to [[Alec Kincade]] outside the [[Myths' Guild]]. A quick way there is using the [[Spirit tree]] to [[Feldip Hills]]. He will let you join the guild if you can discover an ancient secret, and tells you to meet up with [[Dallas Jones]] at [[Karamja Wines, Spirits, and Beers]] on [[Musa Point]]. The fastest way to get to him is use the Karamja teleport on a Amulet of Glory and walk south. Another quick way is to use the TzHaar Fight Pit minigame teleport.You can also use fairy ring DKP then travel south, over the log then north, then use the shortcut.\n\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - hidden laboratory.png|thumb|250px|A hidden laboratory found near Elvarg's lair.]]\nSpeak to [[Dallas Jones]], who will realise you are the Hero of [[Crandor]] after learning that you slayed [[Elvarg]]. He tells you to meet him in her old lair.(The lair is inside the volcano, just head west to find it). Once inside, head north west then north, then east, you will have to climb over the wall. Speak to Dallas Jones again, and then use a [[pickaxe]] on a covered up wall at the north-eastern corner. Should a player forget their pickaxe, just outside her lair, there is a rock with a [[bronze pickaxe]] embedded in it. When the wall crumbles, enter the tunnel to find an ancient laboratory.\n\nInspect the machinery to the east for some [[old notes]], then attempt to inspect the mural. A Level 100 [[Spawn (Dragon Slayer II)|spawn]] will burst out from the nearby strange egg and attack you; kill it. Once it is killed, inspect the mural again, which illustrates dragons and fungi with the word \"Lithkren\". Dallas recalls an [[House on the Hill|old settlement]] on [[Fossil Island]] with similar architecture as the laboratory, with one of the many books he found there mentioning a place called Lithkren. He will ask that you make your way to the [[House on the Hill]] to meet him there.\n\n==The House on the Hill==\n'''Items required:'''\u00a0''None.'' '''Recommended:''' ''7+ free inventory spaces.''\n\nThe quickest way to reach the [[House on the Hill]] is with an enchanted [[digsite pendant]]; this required having travelled to the House at least once. If players have not done so, they must reach the House by foot.\n\nOnce inside, climb down the trapdoor and speak to [[Dallas]]. He will tell the player that he had read through the ancient books again, and determines that the grid on the floor is a map of the island. He will ask you to find 24 [[map piece]]s, which are found near or around the House; don't go past the bridges, as there's nothing there.\n\n*There are five scraps in the open chest at the same floor as you.\n*There are three more scraps in the open chest at the top floor.\n*There are seven scraps in a hook briar south of the house.\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II puzzle solution.png|thumb|250px|right|The completed map of Fossil Island]]\n*There are five in a mushtree just east of the house, near the strange stone.\n*There are four in the fungi next to the staircase outside.\n\nOnce all map parts are given to Dallas, the map now must be completed. The map consists of 24 tiles, five of which will be stuck to the board, signifying that's their final position. The free pieces must be rotated and dragged around the interface in order to make progress.\n\nOnce all the map tiles have been correctly positioned, the puzzle will automatically close and appear on the floor, with Dallas determining the north-westernmost island to be [[Lithkren]]. Dallas will then ask you to look for [[Jardric]] for a boat, since he does not wish to ask the Museum expedition for it, as it requires a lot of paperwork and time to do so. Jardric can be found by the [[Fossil Island General Store|General Store]] within the [[Museum Camp]].\n\n==To Lithkren!==\n''Items required: A [[hammer]], [[saw]], [[catspeak amulet]], 8 [[oak plank]]s, 10 [[swamp paste]], 12+ [[nails]] of any kind. (Optional: [[Digsite pendant]])''\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - building rowboat.png|thumb|left|250px|Building the rowboat to Lithkren.]]\nSpeak to [[Jardric]]. You will ask on [[Dallas Jones]]'s behalf for a boat, but he tells you that all the boats around the island are owned by the [[Varrock Museum]], so he suggests that you build one instead. He will tell you that you will need eight [[oak plank]]s, 10 [[swamp paste]], 12 [[nails]] of any kind ('''note''': extra nails are recommended, in case some bend), a [[saw]], and a [[hammer]].\n\nOnce these materials have been obtained, players should make their way just west of the [[Wyvern Cave]] entrance in the [[Mushroom Forest]] and build the rowboat. It is suggested that players unlock the [[Magic Mushtree]] for quick-access to the boat for future use. This is located just north-east of the rowboat at the transportation icon [[File:Transportation icon.png]]. With the enhanced [[digsite pendant]], this is the fastest way to [[Lithkren]].\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Lithkren.png|thumb|250px|Lithkren, an ancient dragonkin fortress.]]\nAfter the rowboat has been built, players can freely travel to and from the island.\n\nTake the boat to Lithkren. Head north, then go up the stairs on the eastern side of the southwestern building. Go down the trapdoor to the south, down the stairs to the north, then follow the path. Meet [[Dallas]] at the bottom. He tells you that he found these doors but can't open them.\n\nSearch the nearby burnt skeleton along the east wall for [[Aivas' diary]]. Read it to discover that a battle took place on Lithkren, lead by none other than [[Robert the Strong]], a hero who lived during the [[Fourth Age]], well known for defending humanity against the [[dragonkin]]. Speak to Dallas again, telling him that Robert the Strong was reincarnated into [[Bob (cat)|Bob]] the cat. While finding the notion absurd, he asks you to track down Bob while he processes this new information.\n\n==Bob the Cat==\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - gift of catspeak.gif|frame|The Sphinx grants the player the ability to speak to cats without the catspeak amulet.]]\nFind [[Bob (cat)|Bob]], who can be located in a large array of places. Using your [[catspeak amulet (e)]] from [[A Tail of Two Cats]] will prove very useful here. Bob is located in a different area for everyone, but a few common places he can be found are listed below:\n* [[Varrock]] west bank anvils\n* [[Burthorpe]] in front of the games room\n* [[Catherby]] docks or inside the Fletching shop\n* [[Falador]] east bank\n* Northern-most part of [[White Wolf Mountain]]\n* [[Draynor Manor]] graveyard\n* [[Mudskipper Point]] near [[Thurgo]]\n* [[Sarah's Farming Shop|Farming shop]] south of Falador near the herb patch\n* [[Seth Groats]]' chicken pen north of [[Lumbridge]]\n''(Make sure you have your amulet of catspeak to understand him. A very quick way to find Bob is to go to Varrock west bank anvils and hop worlds until you find him.)''\n\nWith your amulet of catspeak equipped, speak to Bob. You tell Bob about you needing his memories as [[Robert the Strong]], which he can't remember. You suggest to talk to the [[Sphinx]] again, to which he agrees.\n\nTravel to [[Sophanem]], and speak to the [[Sphinx]]. Before asking for her help, the Sphinx will grant you the ability to speak with cats without the amulet of catspeak, as you've proven yourself to be a friend of the felines. Tell the Sphinx of your problems; unfortunately, she can't help you, as she can't enter Bob's mind and choose specific memories of his life. However, you then remember the [[Oneiromancer]], who may be more capable to help you and Bob. Head to [[Lunar Isle]], and make sure you bring your [[Seal of passage]] if you haven't completed the [[Elite Fremennik Diary|Fremennik Elite Diaries]] yet!\n\n==Robert the Strong==\n''Items needed: [[Seal of passage]], [[tinderbox]], [[goutweed]], 1 [[astral rune]], [[hammer]], [[pestle and mortar]], fighting equipment (good ranged defensive [[armour]] and [[food]]) NOTE: Ranged attacks are ineffective. 100,000 coins and\u00a0teleport\u00a0to Lunar Isle per\u00a0death(recommended for safety).''\n\nHead to the [[Oneiromancer]], who is near the astral altar, and ask her about unlocking Bob's memories. She will tell you that you must make another [[dream potion]]. She will give you a [[dream vial]]. Fill it with water, and use your [[goutweed]] on it. Next, use a [[hammer]] on an [[astral rune]], and use the resulting [[astral rune shards]] on a [[pestle and mortar]], and use the [[ground astral rune]] on the dream vial to finish the [[dream potion]]. Once you make the potion, light the ceremonial brazier to the building at the far west and use the dream potion on it.\n[[File:Fighting Robert the Strong.png|thumb|left|250px|A player faces Robert the Strong.]]\nEntering Bob's dream, [[Not Bob]] tells you that the guardian needs to be defeated to bring back Bob's memories. You must fight [[Robert the Strong]]. He is level 194 and uses [[Ranged]]. [[Prayer]] can be used during this fight; however, he is able to hit through prayer; it's highly recommended to bring food as he is quite accurate and his normal attacks can hit in the 20's. [[Crush]] attacks work the best, as his crush defence is the lowest. Make sure to maximise your [[Ranged Defence]] and crush attack. Using [[Verac the Defiled's equipment]] is a recommended option due to its crush bonuses alongside having a 25% chance to ignore Robert's defences. For players with lower levels (less than 70 [[Defence]] and [[Attack]]), [[Granite equipment]] with a [[Leaf-bladed battleaxe]] can be a good alternative.\n\nWhen Robert says: \"Let's see if you can hide from this!\", run to a pillar and hide behind it. This will protect you from a strong arrow, which will deal very heavy damage (50+) and deactivate your current prayer(s) if it hits you. It is best to eat any food to heal at this point while running to allow you to continuously hit without pause during the fight. Robert will then teleport you back to him for being a coward. Wait until he teleports you to attack, as clicking before will cause your character to path away from Robert before attacking. Repeat until he is defeated.\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - confronting dragonkin.png|thumb|300px|[[Aivas]], [[Tristan]], [[Odysseus]], [[Robert the Strong]], and [[Camorra]] confronting a [[Dragonkin (Dragon Slayer II)|dragonkin]] on [[Lithkren]].]]\n[[Bob (cat)|Bob]] will then remember everything now that the guardian is killed. A cutscene ensues, with [[Aivas]], [[Tristan]], [[Odysseus]], [[Robert the Strong]], and [[Camorra]] confronting a [[Dragonkin (Dragon Slayer II)|dragonkin]] in the dungeon beneath [[Lithkren]].\n\nIf you die fighting Robert, a chest near the brazier will allow you to reclaim items for a fee of 100,000 [[coins]]. Don't die again anywhere though, or the contents will be lost! [[Barrows armour]] will not break if you die, they will simply be placed in the magic chest.\n\nIf you leave the dream you do '''NOT''' have to remake the dream potion. You can re-enter the dream by talking to Bob.\n\n==The Dragon key==\n[[Bob (cat)|Bob]] tells you that he hid several key pieces around the world after the incident.\n\n(Using [[fairy rings]] and teleport tablets will reduce some of the time of the trip.)\n\n===Karamja key piece===\n''Items needed: [[Food]], [[axe]], [[machete]], [[energy]] restoration ([[Stamina potion]]s and [[Saradomin brew]]s recommended).'' '''Note:''' Players with 79 [[Agility]] can access a vine [[shortcut]] into the [[jungle]] without needing an axe or machete.\n\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II  - Karamjan Temple entrance.png|thumb|right|Location of the maze entrance.]]\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II  - Karamjan Temple maze route.png|thumb|right|The route to reach the centre of the temple.]]\n[[Bob (cat)|Bob]] tells you that he hid the [[Karamja]] key on the south coast of Karamja; the [[Kharazi Jungle]]. Head towards the south-eastern area of the shore, where there's staircases leading underground. This takes you to the [[Karamjan Temple]], a maze with the key piece in the centre.\n\nYou have to navigate the maze, with traps consisting of spike and man traps. The spikes can be disabled through [[Thieving]], and man traps leaped over with [[Agility]]. Note that toggling [[running]] off while leaping over the traps seems to improve the chance of success. To make matters worse, there are also multiple level 124 [[stone guardian]]s wandering the area in a [[multi-combat]] environment. Each stone guardian only uses one combat style (indicated by the colour on them), so [[pray]] accordingly. Go west, south, east all the way, north, west, south. The traps will do more damage than the guardians so be on the lookout for wall traps.\n\n*'''Red''': [[Melee]]\n*'''Green''': [[Ranged]]\n*'''Blue''': [[Magic]]\n\nOnce you reach the center, grab the [[key piece]]. The plinth also activates to for a two-way transport between the entrance and center.\n\n===Morytania key piece===\n''Items needed: [[Spade]], [[ghostspeak amulet]], [[glassblowing pipe]], [[dragonstone]], 2 [[molten glass]], non-food healing ([[Saradomin brew]]s recommended) or [[druid pouches]] if bringing [[food]], [[Teleports]] to [[Varrock]], [[Port Phasmatys]], [[Draynor Manor]], and [[Mort Myre]] (recommended)''\n\n[[File:Varrock census records location.png|right|thumb|Location of the [[Varrock census records|Census records]].]]\n[[Bob (cat)|Bob]] tells you that [[Tristan]] held onto this [[key piece]]. Go to [[Varrock]], and speak to [[Reldo]] regarding this. He'll tell you of a book containing census records, and that he doesn't remember where it was, but knows that it had a red cover. Search the bookcases until you find the [[Varrock census records]]. Bring it back to Reldo for further inquiry. According to the records, it appears Tristan's descendants may have settled in [[Port Phasmatys]], as that is where most [[Misthalin]] migrants settle.\n\nMake your way to Port Phasmatys, and make sure you have your [[ghostspeak amulet]] equipped. Speak to the [[ghost villager]]s, and they'll lead you to [[Sarah (Port Phasmatys)|Sarah]] in the house just west of the bank with a range. Speak to her about the key; she buried it in the swamp to prevent the [[vampyre]]s from obtaining it, and does not wish for it to be found, as she believes it is safer that way.\n\nYou'll remark about a device that may find it, so head to [[Draynor Manor]] and speak to [[Ava]]. She can make you the device if you make her a locator orb, from '''two''' pieces of [[molten glass]] and a cut [[dragonstone]] with a [[glassblowing pipe]]. Make an [[inert locator orb]], then give it to her. After some adjustments, she will give you a [[locator orb]].\n\nThe orb acts much like similar items, damaging the player when used in return for telling you where it is. The key piece will be located in a semi-random location within [[Mort Myre Swamp]]. Make sure you have food to last the trip. Be wary of [[ghast]]s, as they may rot your food. Once you find the exact location denoted by a red game text message, use your [[spade]] to dig it up.\n\n'''NOTE:''' While you can't die from the orb's damage directly, the ghasts in the Mort Myre Swamp can sometimes deal one or two hitpoints of damage.\n\n===Ungael key piece===\n''Items needed: [[Combat equipment]] ([[dragonfire]] protection, [[venom]] protection, good [[ranging]] equipment, [[runes]] for [[Crumble Undead]] is recommended, [[food]], [[prayer]]), 100,000 coins and [[teleport]] to [[Rellekka]] per [[death]] (recommended for safety)''\n\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - fighting Vorkath.png|thumb|250px|A player faces Vorkath.]]\n[[Bob (cat)|Bob]] tells you that he hid another key in an [[Ungael|abandoned dragonkin fortress]] north-west of [[Rellekka]]. Talk to [[Brundt the Chieftain]] about this fortress, and he tells you that a deadly beast has slain many of his warriors who went there. He'll give you permission to fight the dragon, and that [[Torfinn]] will take you there. In order to pass through, you will have to slay [[Vorkath]], an [[undead]] [[blue dragon]]. You will want to bring [[venom]] immunity items, as both Vorkath and the [[Spider (Ungael)|spiders]] in the dragonkin laboratory are capable of envenoming the player.\n[[File:Vorkath acid barrage.gif|thumb|Vorkath's acid and fire barrage, one of his most deadly attacks.]]\nVorkath has a few attacks. Keep [[Protect from Magic]] activated at all times, and watch for his purple fire attack as it will disable your [[prayers]], thus forcing you to reactivate them. When he barrages [[poison]] in the air, it will fall spread on random tiles in the arena; do not stand on these tiles as they deal damage and heal Vorkath. Turning off [[run]] is strongly recommended to navigate the poison spots. After this attack, Vorkath will rapidly barrage the player with fire attacks. The player must then walk (not run) as they land on the tile you were standing on. Be careful to avoid the poison spread out by his earlier attack, and always keep moving during the dragonfire barrage, or you will incur heavy damage rapidly.\n\nWhen Vorkath uses his freeze attack, kill the [[Zombified Spawn]] ([[Crumble Undead]] strongly recommended) that will spawn before it can hit you as it deals a decent amount of damage (30~). Vorkath also occasionally launches a fireball into the air, which will target the tile the player is on. RUN! If hit by this attack, it can easily deal up to 70 damage. \n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Ungael laboratory.png|thumb|250px|left|Inside the Ungael laboratory.]]\nOnce he is defeated, move past him to the north-west to find a [[Dragonkin]] laboratory. Small level 35 spiders are here that can inflict venom, if you die you will lose your stuff. Pull a lever in the south-west with at least 15% run. Once that lever is pulled, run to the locked room in the east for a [[dragon key piece]] and an [[ancient key]]. '''MAKE SURE YOU GRAB BOTH OF THESE BEFORE LEAVING!''' If you forget one of these items, you will need to return; fortunately, you do not need to fight Vorkath again.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Kourend key piece===\n''Items needed: [[Magic]] and [[Ranged]] protective [[armour]], [[food]], and a [[light source]]''\n\nBob tells you that [[Camorra]] hid her [[key piece]] in a land far west. Head to [[Amelia]] in the [[Shayzien House]]. She is in a hut south-west from the bank, west of the clothes store. Players can use the [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|DJR}} to teleport to the Shayzien House.\n\nWhile you are nearby, grab a [[tinderbox]] and a [[light source]] from the bank if you haven't already. Speak to her, and she will tell you to go to the [[Shayzien Crypts]], whose entrance is found in the south-western part of the [[Graveyard of Heroes]].\n\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II crypt map.png|thumb|right|Map of the crypt.]]\nThere are three levels in the crypt, and you will need to make your way to the bottom level. Activate [[Protect from Magic]], as there are multiple high-levelled [[zombies]] and [[skeletons]] (level 132) in a [[multi-combat]] environment. The zombies and skeletons use [[Ranged]], [[Magic]] or [[Melee]], so run past them as fast as you can until you reach the crypt. From the upper level, take the ladder in the north-east corner down to the middle level. Then, make your way to the far east ladder to get to the bottom level. Once you reach the bottom level, head to the centre, and enter the southern doors.\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Camorra's tomb.png|thumb|250px|A player in Camorra's tomb in the Shayzien Crypts.]]\nInspect Camorra's tomb and solve a riddle. Grab the four busts of [[Robert bust|Robert]], [[Camorra bust|Camorra]], [[Tristan bust|Tristan]], and [[Aivas bust|Aivas]] from the corners and place them accordingly on the plinths, based on what the puzzle states.\n\n'''The puzzle can be solved in a few steps (Fill in with table):'''\n\n\"The one from '''[Location]''' sat at the north of the table\": Place this statue '''north'''.\n\n\"Opposite the one with '''[Weapon]'''\": Place this statue '''south'''.\n\n\"The one with '''[Weapon]''' asked the .....\": Place this statue '''west'''.\n\nPlace the leftover statue '''east'''.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Person\n!Weapon\n!Location\n|-\n|Aivas\n|Crossbow\n|Zartharim\n|-\n|Camorra\n|Axe\n|Saranthium\n|-\n|Robert\n|Bow\n|Arkney\n|-\n|Tristan\n|Sword\n|Karville\n|}\n\n'''Note:''' If you get the puzzle wrong, you'll be teleported back to the top floor, and the puzzle will randomise itself.\n\nOnce you unlock the crypt, take the dragon key piece inside.\n\n==Reforging the key==\n''Items required: All 4 pieces, [[ancient key]], runes for 3 [[Fire Wave]] OR 3 Fire Surge spells, [[hammer]], [[dragonfire]] protection. (Recommended: Food, armour, anti-dragon shield or dragonfire shield AND antifire potion, [[Barbarian Outpost]] teleport, [[stamina]], [[food]], [[Digsite pendant]])''\n[[File:Dragon fire - DS2.gif|thumb|A player lighting the dragon forge.]]\nTravel to the [[Ancient Cavern]] (whirlpool south of [[Barbarian Assault]]), it is not necessary to talk to [[Dallas]] before forging the pieces. It is essential that you have started the [[Firemaking]] part of [[Barbarian Training]] to gain access to the Ancient Cavern, or you will end up failing to gain entry and will thus be washed up at the shore to the south.\n[[File:Dragon forge - DS2.png|thumb|Ancient dragon forge.]]\nOnce on the floor with the [[brutal green dragon]]s, follow the east wall until you reach stairs leading to the [[mithril dragon]]s. Once up the stairs, travel west to a door on the north side of the wall and open the mithril door with the ancient key. Go inside. Use [[Fire Wave]] or [[Fire Surge]] on the three dragon head structures. Go back out and travel east and down the stairs. Run to the south-west corner where the [[barbarians]] are and go up the stairs. Continue to the end and forge the four pieces together by using one of the several anvils.\n\nOnce you have the [[Dragon Key]], go back to the dragon door, which is located on [[Lithkren]] using the boat on the west coast of [[Mushroom Forest]] on [[Fossil Island]], and place the key into it.\n\n==The Ultimate Weapon==\nEnter through the doors and continue down the hallway. Talk to Dallas, a cutscene will then play. You, [[Bob (cat)|Bob]] and [[Dallas]] will find a live dragon, before a [[Dragonkin]] approaches. The Dragonkin, [[Zorgoth]], reveals its name as [[Galvek]], the Dragonkin word for \"Fate\". Zorgoth notices that [[Robert the Strong|Robert]] has changed forms, and reveals that the attempt on his life by Robert had failed. He somehow recognises the player, but not Dallas, who will then ask Zorgoth about Elvarg, and why she attacked Crandor.\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Zorgoth appears.png|thumb|260px|left|Zorgoth, a dragonkin, appears before you, Bob, and Dallas.]]\nZorgoth reveals that as their numbers are dwindling, the dragonkin required a new weapon to turn the tide against the humans. Elvarg was the first of these dragons intended to destroy humanity, but remarks that it was a failure, and continued experimenting on various other creatures in various laboratories, including the one on Lithkren, where they began working on the ultimate weapon: a dragon that can control the minds of other dragons. However, [[Robert the Strong|Robert]] had launched an assault on the island, forcing him to seal the laboratory, with himself in it, in hopes that his kind will reopen the doors to resume their work. However, due to Robert's actions, this never happened.\n\nZorgoth will state that being sealed in here has given him hundreds of years to perfect his creation, the dragonkin's salvation. Dallas will interrupt, asking why he intends to annihilate humanity. Zorgoth answers by saying that they were defending themselves from the humans, while Robert argues that they were the ones being attacked. Zorgoth continues, saying that only a handful of dragonkin who gave in to the curse of the {{RSL|Stone of Jas|Stone}} attacked the humans, but they were not willing to distinguish the aggressive dragonkin from the peaceful ones, and neither will he, stating humanity is a disease. He calls Galvek out of the incubation chamber, and Galvek launches fireballs at the group, killing Dallas. You grab Bob and narrowly avoid them.\n\nOutside, [[Jardric]] will investigate and find Zorgoth and Galvek. He fires a shot at Galvek, before being knocked away by Zorgoth. Galvek smashes through the roof and flies off with Zorgoth, who is preparing to organise the dragons for the assault on humanity.\n\n==A World United==\n''Items required: [[Ardougne teleport]], [[Varrock teleport]], [[Falador teleport]], transportation to [[Rellekka]]''\n\n[[Jardric]] and [[Bob (cat)|Bob]] suggest that you should get [[King Roald]]'s aid, so go to [[Varrock]] and tell him of the threat. [[Roald]] trusts your judgement, so he asks you to get the other kingdoms and nations to work together; [[King Lathas]], [[Sir Amik Varze]] and [[Brundt the Chieftain]], while his advisor [[Aeonisig Raispher]] attempts to reach out to other people, as they will need all the help they can get.\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - the kingdoms unite.png|thumb|300px|The kingdoms of Gielinor meet to discuss the dragonkin threat.]]\nOnce all three have made their way to Varrock, head back to the [[Varrock Palace|castle]] and speak to Roald, who has organised a meeting in the dining room, and have agreed to launch an assault on [[Ungael]], where the dragons are gathering. Regardless of what you say of the plan, Bob will ask to speak with you outside.\n\nBob will tell you that [[dragonkin]] are immune to most weapons, and that the dragon's assault will not cease until [[Zorgoth]] is dead. He reveals that when Jardric attacked [[Galvek]], Zorgoth was injured as well, leading him to the conclusion that Galvek and Zorgoth are linked, and share each other's pain; killing Galvek will kill Zorgoth as well.\n\nAfter talking to Bob, head to [[Rellekka]].\n\n==The Assault==\nThe combined fleet will make their way towards the Dragonkin Fortress on [[Ungael]] to stop [[Zorgoth]]. Zorgoth will send his own dragon army to counter the advance. Checkpoints are listed in parts and stages.\n\nIf you die during Parts II-V, you can reclaim your items from [[Torfinn]], costing 100,000 [[coins]] each time. Completing each part acts as a \"checkpoint\", so you are free to teleport out after completing a part if you are low on supplies and do not have to restart from the beginning.\n\n===Part I===\n''Note: Ensure you have four free inventory spaces for acquired items ([[Revitalisation potion (Dragon Slayer II)|Revitalisation potion]], [[hammer]], [[water container]], [[swamp paste]]).''\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Brundt's ship.png|thumb|250px|Defending Brundt's ship from the dragon's assault.]]\nSpeak to Torfinn in Rellekka. You will be placed on [[Brundt the Chieftain|Brundt's]] ship, and will need to repel a dragon assault for four minutes. The dragons will launch [[dragonfire]] towards the ship, either causing leaks, damaging the masts, wounding the rowers, or causing fires. There are several crates containing items to repair the ship and maintaining its integrity. If the ship's integrity falls to 0%, you will need to restart again.\n\n*{{plink|Revitalisation potion (Dragon Slayer II)|Revitalisation potion|alt=Revitalisation potion}} - Used to heal Fremennik warriors\n*{{plink|Hammer}} - Used to repair damaged masts\n*{{plink|Water container}} - Used to douse fires\n*{{plink|Swamp paste}} - Used to fill leaks\nWhen you are nearing the end of the 4 minutes you will notice that the frequency of damage to the ship will increase significantly and it will be impossible to have the ship cleared of all damage. The best tactic here is to always repair damage/heal the warrior closest to you. A stamina potion could be useful here.\n\n===Part II===\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - crossing shipwrecks.png|thumb|220px|Crossing the shipwrecks.]]\nWhat remains of the army advances onward, while the rest take their time to catch up. Before navigating through the shipwrecks, make sure you have full [[dragonfire]] protection, as there are several dragons, which will launch [[dragonfire]] at you throughout the area. You will want to bring a lot of\u00a0[[food]], as you can fail some of the obstacles and take damage. There are several fancier ships, which act as \"milestones\". Several of the leaders will be fighting a lone dragon; you will need to kill it to proceed. The first \"fancy\" ship has a [[red dragon]]; the second has an [[iron dragon]], and the last has a [[brutal green dragon]].\n\n<gallery>\nDragon Slayer II - Wise Old Man and Brundt.png|The [[Wise Old Man]] and [[Brundt the Chieftain]] fight against a [[red dragon]].\nDragon Slayer II - Achietties and Jardric.png|[[Achietties]] and [[Jardric]] fight against an [[iron dragon]].\nDragon Slayer II - Oneiromancer and Sir Tiffy.png|The [[Oneiromancer]] and [[Sir Tiffy Cashien]] fight against a [[brutal green dragon]].\n</gallery>\n===Part III===\nHelp the [[Varrock]] guard fight several dragons on Varrock's grand ship. This consists of two [[green dragons]] and [[blue dragons]]. The dragons fight the guards, but will shift their [[aggression]] towards you when you get near.\n\n===Part IV===\nOnce these four dragons are killed, [[Zorgoth]] and [[Galvek]] board the ship. Galvek launches [[dragonfire]], which kills four Varrock guards. He then launches dragonfire at you, prompting you to leap away. However, [[Bob (cat)|Bob]] is killed in the process as he was right behind you.\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - fighting rune dragon.png|thumb|280px|The heroes aid you in a fight against a [[rune dragon]].]]\nThere are two waves of dragons to deal with, with another dragon taking its place once the previous one is killed. Checkpoint occurs after completion of each wave.\n\n*Wave 1: [[Black dragon]] > [[Steel dragon]] > [[Brutal red dragon]]\n*Wave 2: [[Mithril dragon]] > [[Adamant dragon]] > [[Rune dragon]]\n[[File:Galvek - Dragonfire.png|left|50px|High damage fire attack.]]\nDuring these fights, Galvek will launch a dragonfire ball attack from the sky that can deal up to 115 damage regardless of your dragonfire protection if you don't move from your spot. If you are adjacent to the dragonfire, it deals half damage instead. Either stay within visible range of Galvek and look out for dragonfire animation, or turn on sound effects and listen for the sound effect (a long sustained rumbling noise).\n\nAt the start of Wave 2, the leaders will appear and assist you in battling the dragons, though you shouldn't expect them to do much for you. If you happen to leave or die here, you will return on Wave 2 and do not have to complete Wave 1 again. Lower levels can use this to their advantage by switching from [[Ranged gear]] to [[Magic gear]] between waves.\n\nPlayers having trouble with Wave 2 can stand underneath the [[Adamant dragon|adamant]] and [[rune dragon]]s, which prevents the dragons from attacking and allows the leaders to slowly kill them. It should be noted that Galvek will continue to launch dragonfire \u2014 walking south and [[tanking]] a hit from the dragons is advised when this occurs.\n\n===Part V===\n''Recommended: 1-3 [[Super restore(4)]], [[Ranging potion(4)]], high-healing [[food]], Dragonfire Potion, Anti-dragonfire shield or better, many [[Ruby bolts (e)]] and [[Diamond bolts (e)]].''\n\n[[Galvek]] will finally confront you for a fight. The dragon has 1,200 [[Hitpoints]] and four phases. The leaders don't assist you, but instead fight two [[brutal black dragon]]s that [[Zorgoth]] planned to use to attack the player.\n\nIn addition to using all three forms of [[combat]] and the high-damage [[dragonfire]], Galvek uses the following abilities. Phasing occurs after 300 damage is inflicted.\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Galvek's fire traps.png|thumb|200px|Galvek's fire traps during phase 1.]]\n*'''Phase 1''': Galvek can launch fire traps at range, which if touched, will deal up to your max health in damage. They automatically explode after a set amount of time or if Galvek is forced into the next phase. Fighting Galvek moving north to south in front of him will ensure you always avoid the traps and don't take physical damage. '''Pray''' '''Mage''' during this phase.\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Galvek's hurricane.png|thumb|left|200px|Galvek's hurricane attack during phase 2.]]\n*'''Phase 2''': Galvek will harness the power of air on the west side, and begins to use Ranged attacks. He can launch a hurricane that will drain stats, especially [[run energy]]. '''Pray Ranged''' from this phase on.\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Galvek's tsunami.png|thumb|200px|Galvek's tsunami attack during phase 3.]]\n*'''Phase 3''': Galvek will harness the power of water on the east side. He can launch a tidal wave, which has one gap as the escape route. After launching a tidal wave, he will follow up with the launched dragonfire ball attack. Waves can deal up to 109+ damage if hit. '''<span style=\"color:red\">WARNING:</span>''' Turn [[Auto Retaliate]] off, otherwise there's a chance you'll walk into the wave when he attacks you.\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - entombed in rock.png|thumb|left|200px|Galvek's rock tomb attack during phase 4.]]\n*'''Phase 4''': Galvek will harness the power of earth, landing on the middle of the ship. He can launch an earth projectile that entombs the player in stone if they are hit by it.\n**If one moves as soon as Galvek fires an ability, it is possible to never be frozen by Galvek's earth attacks and never damaged by Galvek's special dragonfire. If you are hit, you can wait until you are freed while making sure the special dragonfire is not being fired. If it is fired while you are stuck, teleport out to save yourself 100k.\n\nFor this fight, it's highly recommended to use [[Ranged]], as while he is weakest against [[stabbing]] attacks, he is just as weak against Ranged. His high health pool means that [[Ruby bolts (e)]] can deal up to 100 damage, which significantly speeds up the battle. Once he is below 150 health, you should switch to [[Diamond bolts (e)]].\n\nIf the player is having trouble with Ranged (or simply is looking for a unique fight experience), it is possible (and not excessively difficult) to defeat Galvek entirely with Melee, provided the player has high melee stats (90+ in Attack, Strength, AND Defence). Players with 90+ Attack and high Stab bonuses will consistently hit Galvek, reducing his health rather quickly, and at a much more consistent rate than utilizing Ruby Bolts (e), which can be unreliable at times. Another advantage to a Melee attempt is that Galvek\u2019s own Melee attack is fairly inaccurate (far less accurate than any of his other standard attacks) provided the player has a respectable Defence level (90+). If attempting this, a Zamorakian Hasta (as Galvek is weak to Stab attacks) and Dragonfire Shield are essential here. As well, meleers should have Protect From Magic and Piety active for the entirety of the fight (all phases), and \u201dtank\u201d armour should be equipped, such as full Torag (for example).\n\nFor lower-levelled players (under 70 Defence), this fight is highly based on RNG, so using [[Blessed dragonhide armour]] along with a [[Dragon crossbow]], if possible, will be very useful. This fight can take tens of tries at a low level because of the randomness of the enchanted bolts that do the majority of the damage so be prepared for this. It's highly likely that in your first few tries you may need to teleport out if you've run out of food by the end of phase 3, or have used too much food in the first 3 phases.\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Zorgoth death.gif|thumb|Zorgoth incinerated by his own creation.]]\nOnce Galvek reaches zero health, he spirals out, falling to the ground. In a last-ditch effort to destroy the player, he fires a massive fireball which shoots backwards, completely incinerating Zorgoth.\n\nNote: If both you and Galvek die at the same time, you don't need to fight it again. When you go to the fleet, the cutscene of Galvek dying will play.\n\nWith Galvek slain and the Dragonkin menace defeated, the battle has been won.\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II - Ending.png|thumb|200px|A player being congratulated after defeating Galvek.]]\n\n==Ending==\nYou will be brought back to [[Burthorpe]], where you, [[Unferth]] and [[Neite]] will mourn [[Bob (cat)|Bob's]] death. Make your way back to [[Alec]] and inform him of your achievements; he will be impressed and initiate you as a member of the [[Myths' Guild]].\n\n'''Congratulations, Quest Complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards|name = Dragon Slayer II\n|qp = 5\n|image = [[File:Dragon Slayer II reward scroll.png|center]]\n|rewards =\n*{{Skill clickpic|Smithing|25,000}} [[Smithing]] [[experience]]\n*{{Skill clickpic|Mining|18,000}} [[Mining]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Agility|15,000}} [[Agility]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Thieving|15,000}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*Ability to speak to cats without the [[Catspeak amulet]]\n*Access to the [[Myths' Guild]]\n**Ability to make [[Super antifire potion]]s by speaking to [[Primula]]\n**4x 25,000 experience in [[Magic]], [[Ranged]], [[Strength]], [[Attack]], [[Defence]] or [[Hitpoints]] by speaking to [[Ellen]]\n**Access to [[Fountain of Uhld]] where dragonstone jewellery (excluding the [[ring of wealth]]) can be recharged\n**Access to the [[Pool of Dreams]] where players can refight [[Galvek]] or rewatch [[cutscene]]s from the quest\n**Access to the [[wrath altar]]\n*Access to [[adamant dragon|adamant]] and [[rune dragon]]s in the [[Lithkren Vault]]\n*Access to a stronger version of [[Vorkath]] on [[Ungael]]\n*Ability to reforge the [[dragon platebody]] and [[dragon kiteshield|kiteshield]]\n*Ability to have a [[Rune dragon (Construction)|rune dragon]] as a [[Treasure Room]] guardian (requiring 99 [[Construction]] and 25,000,000 [[coins]])\n*Ability to create an [[Ava's assembler]] by bringing [[Vorkath's head]], 75 [[Mithril Arrow]]s, and 4,999 gp (or [[Ava's Accumulator]]) to [[Ava]] in [[Draynor Manor]]\n}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n*[[Relics]] - unlocked after discovering the Crandor dragonkin laboratory\n*[[Lucid Dream]] - unlocked upon entering [[Bob (cat)|Bob]]'s [[Dream World]]\n*[[Lucid Nightmare]] - unlocked during the fight with [[Robert the Strong]]\n*[[On Thin Ice]] - unlocked during the fight with [[Vorkath]]\n*[[The Walking Dead]] - unlocked upon entering the [[Shayzien Crypts]]\n*[[The Forsaken]] - unlocked upon entering the [[Lithkren Vault]]\n*[[Oncoming Foe]] - unlocked during [[Zorgoth]]'s assault\n*[[The Dragon Slayer]] - unlocked during the fight with [[Galvek]]\n*[[Mythical]] - unlocked upon entering the [[Myths' Guild]]\n\n==Trivia==\n[[File:Dragon Slayer II login screen.png|thumb|300px|The log in screen upon the release of the quest.]]\n*A [[Update:Dragon Slayer II Competitions|log in screen competition]] was held around 2 weeks before release to use a player-made log in screen to commemorate release of the quest.

Changing [[spellbook]]s to the [[Lunar spells|lunar set]] may help, as will carrying [[runes]] to teleport back to the bank.\n*Travel northeast from the bank and go down the [[Lunar Isle mine|mine]]\u2014then, crawl through the passageway to reach the [[Cyrisus|fallen man]] (located just southeast of where you entered the cave. The cave entrance will appear as a red line in the wall on your minimap). You can talk to him and inspect him. The inspect option opens a status screen.\n*:'''Note:''' If you didn't bring enough food, you have to run back to the bank; to make it faster and safer, you should use level 69 Lunar Spell, [[Moonclan Teleport]].\n[[File:Dream mentor cyrus stats.png|thumb|220px|Cyrisus isn't well.]]\n*He will need you to increase three stat bars, in this order: health, spirit, and armament.\n*To feed him, you should take three kinds of food\u2014it doesn't matter what food; [[shark]]s aren't better than [[tomatoes]]. Take seven pieces of two kinds and six of the third. Use the food on Cyrisus to feed him. If he refuses it, just give him a different kind of food.\n*:'''Note:''' You can use one type of food by logging out. Using [[sack]]s or [[basket]]s of [[Allotment|farm produce]] is a good idea.\n*:'''Note:''' He won't accept beverages, although he accepts [[wine]].\n*Increasing his spirit is done by talking to him, but just try to choose the most positive things. This part is long, but no dire consequences if you get it wrong. Make sure he's standing up and both his health and spirit are at least at 70 and 72% respectively before you leave the cave.\n[[File:dream mentor bank.png|thumb|220px|Cyrisus' bank.]]\n*For armour, go to the [[bank]] on [[Lunar Isle]] and talk to the most right banker [['Birds-Eye' Jack]]. Tell him you want to access Cyrisus' bank account\u2014from there, select a helmet, top, legs, boots, and weapon. It is guess and check whether or not you got it right. The easiest way to check is using the level 67 Lunar Spell, [[NPC Contact]], to ask Cyrisus whether you chose right. It may take several tries, but eventually, he will tell you your choice is just right\u2014take that set to him in the cave.\n*:'''Note:''' The most common set (for players with combat level determined by melee skills) is a [[dragon med helm]], [[Ahrim's robetop]] and [[Ahrim's robe skirt|robe skirt]], [[ranger boots]] and an [[abyssal whip]]. Cyrisus ends up dressed like a melee fighter.\n*:For archers (players with ranged being the dominant combat skill), the combination is a [[splitbark helm]], [[Karil's leathertop]], [[Torag's platelegs]], [[adamant boots]] and a [[magic shortbow]]. Cyrisus will look like an archer.\n*:For Mages (players with magic being the dominant combat skill), the combination is a [[robin hood hat]], [[dragon chainbody]], [[black d'hide chaps]], [[infinity boots]] and a [[ancient staff]]. Cyrisus will look like a mage.\n\nNow you have to reach 100% in all of his remaining stats. Once Cyrisus has reached 100% in all stats, he'll tell you that he's afraid of [[Combat]]. Afterwards, you'll agree to accompany him to the [[Oneiromancer]]\u2014exit the mine, and go southward.\n\n===Making the potion===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Goutweed]], a [[hammer]], a [[pestle and mortar]] and an [[astral rune]].''\n*Head south to the [[Oneiromancer]]. She is on the southeast of the island near the [[Astral altar]]. Talk to her, and Cyrisus will appear. The Oneiromancer will suggest going into [[Dreamland]] together to solve Cyrisus' fear of combat.\n*The Oneiromancer will give you a [[dream vial]]. Fill this with water.\n*You need to obtain some [[goutweed]], either by growing a [[gout tuber]], or by stealing it from the troll kitchens during [[Eadgar's Ruse]] quest. (It is recommended to grab a second goutweed if you plan on doing [[Dragon Slayer 2]])\n*Use the goutweed with the vial.\n*Use a [[hammer]] with an [[astral rune]], and then, use a [[pestle and mortar]] on the result\u2014 add this to the potion to get a [[Shared dream potion|dream potion]].\n\n===The battles===\n'''''Items required:''' Good [[food]], [[armour]], [[weapon]] and a [[tinderbox]].''\n\nA player with level 70+ in all melee stats without boosting using a super set can still use an entire inventory of sharks during the first form of the boss, it hits incredibly hard and is fairly accurate, even in decent armour such as [[dragon armour]]. The first form however is also the only difficult part of the fight, the other three being safespottable are not a challenge at all.\n\nIt is highly recommended that a player using Melee takes a Halberd to tackle the second and third forms of the boss. The fourth form of the boss is weak and basically not a challenge, so in reality, the entire fight is three bosses, two of which can be fully safespotted.\n*'''Do not bank your [[seal of passage]] for the fight.'''\n*Head back to [[Lunar Isle]]. [[Cyrisus]] will be waiting for you at the Dream Hall (largest building in the west).\n*Bank and prepare for a hard fight. [[Prayer]] is not allowed in the following fights, so stocking up with high-quality food (such as [[shark]]s, [[tuna potato]]es, [[dark crab]]s, or [[anglerfish]]) is recommended or using the [[Blood spell]]s from the [[Ancient spellbook]] ([[Blood Blitz]] is sufficient to beat all of the bosses with no food at 75 [[Defence]] and 80 [[Magic]]). You will need a tinderbox to light the brazier, the [[dream potion]], and lots of food. If you sip from a [[super set]] before entering [[Dreamland]], your stats are retained. '''<span style=\"color:red\">Warning:</span>''' '''If you die in the dream world, any unprotected tradeable equipment dropped on death will be permanently lost! Bring no more than three valuable items that you cannot afford to lose.'''\n*Light the brazier, and talk to Cyrisus to enter the dream state.\n*You will enter his dream world; here, you will have to fight many high level monsters in a row, without prayer. The first form can use Magic but won't do so when you melee it, so it is recommended to kill all the monsters with Melee combat.\n*The second and third monsters may be fought with a [[halberd]]\u2014right beside the lectern are [[safe spot]]s.\n*You can escape the dream world during the battle by using the lectern at the northern end of the room; teleports are not allowed, so this is the only possible escape. You do not need to make another dream potion to enter again, '''but you will have to begin the fight from the beginning'''. If you decide to escape using this route, spam \u201c1\u201d to bypass the confirmation screen as quickly as possible.\n*The first monster is a level 343 named \"[[The Inadequacy]]\", who during the battle summons many little creatures called \"[[A Doubt]]\" (level 78s). This is unquestionably the hardest battle, and if you can make it through this one, the rest should be comparably easy.\n*:'''Note:''' Using a poisoned [[dragon dagger]] is very effective against this one. Using a blow pipe is also very effective as it can hit rapidly and the boss seems to have relatively low ranged defence. Magic is also extremely efficient even in melee armour as this monster has almost no magical defence. Concentrate on the Inadequacy; don't try to fight the [[A Doubt|Doubts]], as they will disappear after the Inadequacy is defeated. Set [[Auto Retaliate]] to off to avoid fighting them.\n*Now, you can use a safe spot. Place your character right beside the lectern, and the second and third monsters will not be able to attack you. This is a good time to use a halberd. You can also use ranged weapons for the second and third monsters.\n*The second monster is a level 223 called \"[[The Everlasting]].\" This should be much easier than \"The Inadequacy,\" but you should still take extreme caution. It is suggested to tank this one so you can safespot the next one with a [[dragon halberd]].\n*The third monster is easier. Still, at level 274, \"[[The Untouchable]]\" should be much easier than the first form. However, it can still do high damage, so take caution. It has high Defence.\n(WARNING: if players are using the lectern as a safespot, immediately after The Everlasting dies players should run out of the safespot, and run back when the Untouchable spawns. This because the Untouchable upon spawning will neglect the safespot and attack the player. The player would be unable to pass through it and thus will have to receive unavoidable and unnecessary damage.)\n*The fourth monster, [[The Illusive]] will appear and disappear regularly during this battle and it isn't really a threat simply run after it to its new spawn-point and hit it, it will then burrow and re-emerge. Being in the middle of the room each time should make it easier to spot its new location. It is similar in combat conditions to a [[Giant Mole]], except that it does not run so far and rarely hits back.\n<gallery>\nFighting the Inadequacy.png\nFighting the Everlasting.png\nFighting the Untouchable.png\nFighting the Illusive.png\n</gallery>\n\n===Finishing up===\nNote: '''DO NOT bank your Seal of Passage after the fight.

If you do not have the 20 [[Agility]] required to cross the log, you will need to enter the fenced area from the south via the gate. He will explain his dilemma of the goblin forces approaching from the south. He will allow you to temporarily join the [[Dwarven Black Guard|Black Guard]], the elite of the dwarven military. After you accept he will give you 6 [[railing]]s and a [[hammer]] (if you do not already have one in your inventory) so that you can help with fixing the railings.\n\nThe damaged railings around the complex are clearly bent, repair these by \"inspecting\" the appropriate sections of railing.

You can also teleport to the Fishing Guild using a [[skills necklace]]. The cave is located just east of the entrance to the Fishing Guild.\n\nThe cave forks into three passages. Take the centre passage and head northwest to find the goblin outpost. Go further northwest to a room filled with crates inside. Search the northern most crate on the east wall (as seen in the picture) and Lollk will jump out. After thanking you for rescuing him, Lollk will run back to Captain Lawgof.\n\n===The dwarven multicannon===\n'''''Items required:''' None.''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' A [[Falador teleport]]/[[amulet of glory]]/[[combat bracelet]] and a [[Camelot teleport]]/[[Ardougne teleport]]/[[skills necklace]].''\n[[File:Dwarf Cannon Repair.png|thumb|220px|The interface shown when using the toolkit on the damaged cannon.]]\nReturn to [[Captain Lawgof]], and he will thank you and ask you to fix his broken multicannon.

This may save you an extremely frustrating long walk or two.\n\nStart the quest by speaking to [[Sanfew]] (if boosting herblore use before talking to him), who lives on the top floor of the herb shop in [[Taverley]] (ask him about the Varrock stone being cleansed). He will ask you to find out the secret of the herb [[Goutweed]], in order to perform the next part of the purifying ritual on the [[Druid's circle]]. Only the [[troll]]s in the [[Troll Stronghold]] know about Goutweed,\u00a0so Sanfew will suggest you speak to his friend [[Eadgar]] who lives near there at the top of [[Trollheim]].\n\n===Getting to Trollheim===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Food]], [[armour]] and [[climbing boots]].''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' An [[Ardougne teleport]].''\n[[File:Eadgar's ruse cave map.png|thumb|200px|Use this route to get to Mad Eadgar's Cave.]]\nYou need to make your way to [[Trollheim]] using the same route as in the [[Troll Stronghold]] quest. Go north from [[Taverley]] to [[Burthorpe]] and follow the mountain path out of the northwestern corner of the town. Go south at the fork in the path to [[Tenzing]]'s house. If you don't already have [[climbing boots]], buy some here from Tenzing for 12 coins. Wear the climbing boots, and climb over the stile in his back yard, following the path north. At the next junction, climb over the rocks, follow the path, and go east at the next fork climbing over rocks as required.\n\nWalk past [[Dad]], and use the northern Arena Exit gate. At the next two junctions, head west and then north, and go into the Cave Entrance. Follow the cave round, and use the exit to appear inside Trollheim.\n:Eadgar is not located in the Troll Stronghold, but rather inside a cave on top of Trollheim on the minimap.\n:You can use the secret entrance to the Troll Stronghold and then walk through to get to Eadgar. The shortcut is at the northern end of the western fork on the map.\n\n===Meeting Eadgar===\nClimb to the top of the hill in the centre of [[Trollheim]] using\u00a0[[Protect from Missiles]]\u00a0as you run past the\u00a0[[Thrower Troll]]s\u00a0to avoid taking large amounts of damage. At the top of Trollheim there is an unmarked cave entrance on the southern side of the summit. When you get to the top, enter the cave and speak to [[Eadgar]] about [[Goutweed]]. He will suggest that you speak to the [[Troll Cook]].\n:If you didn't rescue Eadgar during the [[Troll Stronghold]] quest, you will need to do so. He can be found in the prison in the stronghold. Pickpocket the two sleeping guards to get the key to his cell. Once you've rescued him, he will be in the Trollheim cave on the hill. (Even if you have freed Eadgar, he will still be in the prison cell. If you can't steal a cell key from the sleeping trolls to get him out, you know that you have previously freed Eadgar.)\n\n===The troll cook===\nLeave [[Eadgar]]'s cave, go back down the hill, and head southwest following the path round into the Troll Stronghold. Once in the stronghold, go south and then down the stairs. You'll see four [[Troll Cook]]s here - one of them will be called [[Burntmeat]]. Speak to him, and he will offer to tell you about [[Goutweed]] in exchange for a human to cook in his stew.\n\nGo back and talk to Eadgar. He will have a quick think and then come up with a plan....\n\n===The parrot===\n'''''Items required:'''\u00a0[[Climbing boots]],\u00a0[[Vodka]], [[pineapple chunks]], 10 [[grain]], 2 [[logs]], a [[tinderbox]], 5 [[raw chicken]]s, a [[pestle and mortar]], Herblore [[boost]] (if not level 31), and a [[ranarr potion (unf)]].''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' A [[Games necklace]].''\n\n[[Eadgar]] will tell you he needs a parrot in order to fool the [[troll]]s into thinking you've given them a human. Go to the zoo in [[Ardougne]], and talk to [[Parroty Pete]] at the northern part of the zoo near the [[wolf]] enclosure. Ask him both of the possible questions, and he will tell you that their favourite food is [[pineapple chunks]] and that they will get drunk if you feed them vodka. Do not accidentally drink the vodka or eat the pineapple chunks! Right click your pineapple chunks and use them on your vodka to make [[alco-chunks]], and then use them on the aviary hatch on the west side of the parrot cage. You'll obtain a [[drunk parrot]], and tell Parroty Pete that you will take it to the vet. (Do not drop the parrot or it will fly away. If this does happen, you can talk to Eadgar to retrieve it) While in Ardougne, it's also a good idea to pick up your logs, tinderbox, grain, and raw chicken from the bank.\nTake the parrot to Eadgar. You need to make it look like a human, taste like a human, smell like a human, and talk like a human. (You must do these steps in order, however, you may hand in the items after hiding the parrot.)\n\n[[File:Parrot.png|thumb|220px|Inebriating the Parrot.]]\n:Go back to Eadgar to talk about the rest of his plan before proceeding to the next step.\n:If you pick a Thistle now you can dry it on a fire on the way back to Eadgar. Scroll down to learn how to get the thistle.\n*'''Talk like a human''' - Go back to the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]], and find the prison cells. To get there, go north from the entrance to the stronghold, down the stairs, east through the door, and down another set of stairs. Go a bit further west and hide your parrot under the rack just north of the cells.\n*:You will come back for the parrot later.\n\n*'''Look/Taste like a human''' - Teleport out of Trollheim and grab your 10 grains, 2 logs, tinderbox, 5 raw chicken, pestle and mortar, and unfinished ranarr potion.\n**Note for Ultimate Ironmen: You can make multiple trips with the items if you do not have the inventory space available to bring them in one trip.\n*'''Smell like a human''' - Go to [[Taverley]]. You will see [[Tegid]] washing robes in the lake. Talk to him, and ask for a [[dirty robe]]. Then, threaten him with talking to Sanfew to get one. Take all items to Eadgar.\n\n===Truth serum===\n[[File:Troll Thistle.png|thumb|220px]]\nAfter you've done all of this, [[Eadgar]] will tell you that you need to make a troll truth potion\u00a0so that [[Burntmeat]] won't lie to you about [[Goutweed]]. Look near the grass patches around Eadgar's hill until you find a tiny [[troll thistle|thistle]] growing in one of them. It may take you a while, but keep searching. If unable to find it, one may find it helpful to world hop and check the grass directly north or directly west of the cave. The Thistle's name is yellow when displayed at the top-left of the game window.\n\nOnce you've found the troll thistle, make a fire with your second [[log]], and cook it to get a\u00a0[[dried thistle]].\u00a0If you forgot a second log and/or tinderbox, there is a fire in the cave between the arena and Trollheim. Then, grind it with a [[pestle and mortar]] to make [[ground thistle]]. Finally, [[Greenman's ale|boost]] your Herblore level (if necessary) and add the ground thistle to your [[Ranarr potion (unf)|unfinished ranarr potion]] to make a [[troll potion]].\n\nTalk to Eadgar again. He will take the potion off of you and tell you that the parrot has had enough by now, so you can get it back. Go back to the prison cells in the [[Troll Stronghold]]\u00a0by\u00a0going north from the entrance to the stronghold, down the stairs, east through the door and down another set of stairs, and search the rack to retrieve the parrot and then return to Eadgar.\n\n===Getting Goutweed===\n[[File:Goutweed Map.png|thumb|left|200px|Guide to getting the Goutweed.]]\nAfter you give the parrot to [[Eadgar]], he will give you the [[Fake man]]. Go back to the cooks in the stronghold\u00a0by going south of the entrance and then down the stairs, and give the dummy to [[Burntmeat]]. He'll give you a piece of [[burnt meat]] as a reward (which you can discard as it serves no purpose in the quest). He'll also tell you that the [[Goutweed]] is kept in the storeroom and that you can find the key by searching the Kitchen Drawers.\n\nSearch the drawers in the southeastern corner of the room, and once you have the [[storeroom key]], go down the stairs just to the north. This next part is the hardest as you will need to sneak past the guards. If one of them sees you, you'll be knocked out and kicked out of the storeroom. The rocks hit 0-6 damage. [[Protect from Missiles]] blocks the damage but doesn't prevent getting kicked out.\n\n<gallery>\nGoutweed map 1.png|Wait for the two trolls to intersect each other as seen above, then run ahead, allowing the third lighter coloured troll to pass, and then into the first safe spot.\nGoutweed map 2.png|Once in the first safe spot, wait for the two guards seen on the right to walk parallel to each other and then back down. Then run to the second safe spot.\nGoutweed map 3.png|Once in the second and last safe spot, wait for the guards to clear from around the Goutweed crates and then run next to the crate and steal the Goutweed.\n</gallery>\n\nThe best way to do this is to use the two most eastern guards as an indicator of when to move to the second safe spot. To do this turn on your run and wait until one of the two guards rounds the northern corner of the boxes that they rotate around. As soon as this happens run to the second safe spot. Note that the darker coloured troll patrolling the small section of boxes must also be avoided. Once in the second safe spot simply run to the one of the safe spots adjacent to the crate when the guard that comes north and closest to you turns west, and then click on the goutweed crate.\n\nThe next way to do this is to use the safe spots, which are dead ends surrounded by three crates. Time your movement and run to the first safespot, then wait for your chance to run to the second. You can use the position of the troll guards as an indication of when to move, as the placements of the guards will repeat after one or two cycles. Wait at the second safespot until you get the chance to run to the Goutweed crate and search it. Be careful not to simply click ''search goutweed crate'' as this will get you stuck on the sleeping troll instead of going up to the crate. Make sure you click on the spot adjacent to the crate, and ''then'' click search goutweed crate. You'll be kicked out after you get one piece of goutweed. Also, if you plan to do [[Dream Mentor]] or [[Dragon Slayer II]] at any point, it is recommended to get two extra goutweed as it is a required item in those quests (note: you can only grab one goutweed per attempt and will have to traverse through again).\n\nGive the Goutweed to [[Sanfew]] back in Taverley to finish the quest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Eadgar's Ruse\n|image = [[File:Eadgar's Ruse reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = *{{Skill clickpic|Herblore|11,000}} [[Herblore]] [[experience]]\n*The ability to grow and steal [[Goutweed]], which can be traded for herbs.\n*The ability to use the [[Trollheim Teleport]] spell.\n*The ability to use a [[Scroll of redirection]] to redirect a [[Teleport to house]] tablet to Trollheim.\n}}\n==Required for completing==\n*[[My Arm's Big Adventure]]\n*[[Dream Mentor]]\n*[[Dragon Slayer II]]\n\n{{Eadgar's Ruse}}\n[[Category:Taverley]]"], "Eagles' Peak": ["{{External|rs}}\n{{otheruses|the quest|the location|Eagles' Peak (mountain)}}\n{{Has quick guide}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Eagles' Peak\n|image = [[File:Eagles' peak.png|300px]]\n|number = 116\n|members = Yes\n|release = 28 November [[2006]]\n|update = Eagles' Peak\n|series = None\n|difficulty = Novice\n|developer = Ian Gower\n}}\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Speak to [[Charlie]], one of the keepers at [[Ardougne Zoo]].\n|difficulty = Novice\n|description = The Ardougne Zoo is always looking for new specimens, but one of their anticipated new attractions - a ferret from the north - has been proving elusive.\n\nOne of the Zoo's more eccentric freelance specimen hunters is reported to be on the case, but after setting out for the far western reaches, somewhere between the Piscatoris Fishing Colony and the Tree Gnome Stronghold, nothing more has been heard from him.\n\nWill you be able to use your skills as a Hunter to track him down?

He will ask you to contact a huntsman called [[Nickolaus]] who agreed to capture another ferret, but he hasn't heard from him for some time. He will ask you to look for him. Finally, ask ''\"Sure.

Charlie will tell you to start around the mountains just west of the [[Gnome Stronghold]].\n\n===Eagles' Peak===\n[[File:Nickolaus location.png|thumb|220px|The location of the tent.]]\nHead to [[Eagles' Peak (mountain)|Eagles' Peak]], which is west of the [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]]. If you have access to the [[fairy ring]] network, code {{Fairycode|AKQ}} gets you there relatively fast. You can also use a [[Necklace of passage]] and choose the second option \"The outpost\" and head north-west. At the base of the mountain on the northwest side, you should find a tent, but Nickolaus is no where to be found. Inspect the books on the ground, and you will receive a [[bird book]]. Try to read the book and a [[metal feather]] will fall out of the book.\n\nFollow the path up to the peak, which starts on the south side of the mountain, or use the [[Agility shortcut]] right beside the tent. At the top is a door (disguised as a rocky outcrop) with an inscription of a feather on the north side.\n[[File:Eagles' Peak Dungeon map.png|thumb|left|The Eagles' Peak Dungeon map.]]\n[[File:Eagles Peak Shout nikolaus.png|thumb|220px|Nickolaus is trapped by a giant eagle.]]\nUse the metal feather from the book to open the door. Then, go inside. A few steps into the cave, there is a [[Feathered journal]] on the north side which contains some interesting info, but it is not critical to the quest. The passages split to three tunnels to other areas and another metal door (used later) and to a ledge over a large open area. A [[cutscene]] will start when you enter the ledge and you will talk to Nickolaus, who is trapped across a chasm by a giant eagle that will not let him out of the cave.\n\n===Eagle disguise===\n'''''Items required: '''10 [[eagle feather]]s, [[swamp tar]], a [[yellow dye]], and 50 coins''\n\n[[Nickolaus]] tells you to make a disguise for him. Talk to him about eagles\u2014mention that he is trapped and offer to help. Gather 10'' ''[[eagle feather|eagle feathers]] (piles of giant feathers can be found near the area after you speak to Nickolaus and throughout the cave).\n\nTeleport to [[Varrock]] and go to the [[Fancy Dress Shop]] in the south-east corner (inside of the gated area). The [[fancy-dress shop owner]] will make you 2 giant eagle costumes using the 10 giant feathers, swamp tar, a yellow dye, and 50 coins. Each costume consists of an eagle cape and a fake beak.\n\nWith the two sets of disguises, return to the [[Eagles' Peak (mountain)|Eagles' Peak]] [[Eagles' Peak Dungeon|dungeon]] and shout to Nickolaus again. He wants you to bring the clothes to him.\n\n===Unlocking the eagle door===\n[[File:Eagles Peak Eagle door.png|thumb|220px|The locked Eagle door.]]\nGo to the south-west extremity of the [[Eagles' Peak Dungeon|dungeon]]. You will find a large stone door with an eagle marking, which leads to Nickolaus. You cannot open the door in this state. Three feathers ([[bronze feather|bronze]], [[Silver feather|silver]], [[Golden feather|gold]]) are required to be able to open the door.\n\n====Bronze feather====\n[[File:Eagles Peak Bronze feather.png|thumb|220px|The bronze feather on a pedestal.]]\nWest of the eagle door is a tunnel. The southern-most tunnel leads to a room with a stone pedestal on which sits a [[bronze feather]]. Attempt to take the feather, and the obvious net trap will lift it upwards. Now, operate all four winches in each of the corners, causing the net trap to break. The pedestal will fall down, and it is possible to take the bronze feather. Leave and follow the directions to the [[silver feather]] cave.\n:'''Note:''' You cannot operate the winches before the net trap has activated.\n\n====Silver feather====\n[[File:Eagles' Peak silver feather trail.png|thumb|220px|The trail leading from the pedestal.]]\nA bit further north, a second tunnel leads into another dungeon room, this time with an empty pedestal. You will need to have 27 Hunter to successfully inspect the empty pedestal. Inspect the pedestal, and a partial trail will appear. Follow the trail, and inspect the heap of rocks in the direction the trail points to. If you are correct, the trail from the pedestal is shown to the heap of rocks. Investigate rocks near where the trail ends\u2014if correct, another trail will appear. Repeat until the trail leads to a tunnel in the wall. Click the tunnel in the wall now, and a level-13 [[kebbit]] will attack. Kill it, or use the Right Click threaten option, and it will drop the [[silver feather]].\n\n====Gold feather====\n[[File:Eagles Peak Golden feather.png|thumb|220px|The golden feather on a pedestal.]]\nThe third tunnel entrance is in the north-east corner of the main [[Eagles' Peak Dungeon|dungeon]]. You need to get to the end of a long corridor due west from the entrance. That corridor is blocked by metal eagles and eagle wings. The birds can be moved by putting bird seeds in the bird feeder close to the point where you need the eagle to go to. The eagle wings can be moved by pulling a [[lever]]. There are four levers and five metal eagles.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Lever location\n!Operates on eagle wings\n|-\n|Centre of dungeon\n|East and north-west\n|-\n|East of dungeon\n|North-west\n|-\n|South-west dungeon\n|North-west and south\n|-\n|North-west of dungeon\n|Corridor to feather room\n|}\n\nTo start, take-from the Birdseed holder to get [[odd bird seed]] near the entrance to place in bird feeders. You'll need six to finish the puzzle. Follow the visual guide below which lists the sequence or the steps outlined below the visual guide. \n\nYou need to clear access to the north-west lever, by operating the south-west and centre levers. The north-west lever unlocks the eastern part of the area and gives access to the east lever. Although operating this lever clears a critical eagle wing blocking the corridor to the [[Golden feather (Eagles' Peak)|golden feather]], there are still blocking objects from the actions to get to the east lever. Use the table above to remove any remaining objects blocking the corridor.[[File:Eagles-peak-puzzle.png|thumb|center|500px|Visual guide to obtaining the Golden Feather.]]\nTo solve the puzzle, follow these steps:\n#First pull the lever, which is just north-west of the start.\n#Walk to the south-eastern part of the [[Eagles' Peak Dungeon|dungeon]]. Then, place some bird seed in most south-eastern bird feeder. (marked 2)\n#Place some bird seed in the bird feeder next to the one you just filled. (marked 3)\n#Pull the eastern lever.\n#Walk back to the handle you pulled the first time, just north-west of the start, and pull it again.\n#Walk to the southern part of the dungeon, and put bird seed in the feeder south of the lever you just pulled and west of the lever in the southern part.\n#Pull the lever in the southern part of the dungeon.\n#Go back to the lever you started at, which is just north-west of the start, and put bird feed in the feeder.\n#Pull the lever in the north-western part of the dungeon.\n#Go to the southern part of the dungeon, and put bird feed in the bird feeder closest to the lever there.\n#Place some feed in the bird feeder in the corner of the rails to the east of the bird feeder from step 10.\n#Retrieve the [[Golden feather (Eagles' Peak)|golden feather]] from the pedestal.\n[[File:Eagles Peak Pass eagle.png|thumb|220px|Walking past the eagle with a disguise.]]\nAfter collecting all three feathers (bronze, silver and gold), use each feather on the door which opens it. Walk to [[Nickolaus]] and wear the full eagle disguise to \"walk past\" the eagle guarding Nickolaus. Not wearing a disguise, the eagle will hit you for a small amount of damage.\n\nAfter a short conversation, Nickolaus requests you to meet him back at the camp.\n\nA bit further east are three huge eagles (polar, jungle and desert). After the quest, they can be used as a transport system to the other Hunter areas from the South Woodland Hunter Area.\n\n===Finishing up===\n[[File:Catching the Ferret.png|thumb|220px|Catching the ferret for the zoo.]]\nGo back out of the Eagles' Peak [[Eagles' Peak Dungeon|dungeon]] and go down the rock climb. On the ground where the tent you were at before is, talk to Nickolaus and he'll teach you how to catch [[ferret]]s. You do not need a box trap for this part of the quest. If you click on the cutscene where you retrieve the box trap you will not catch the ferret. If you accidentally release the ferret you are able to catch a new one with the box trap Nickolaus has given you.\nGo back to [[Ardougne Zoo]] with the ferret you caught. Talk to [[Charlie]] who gives the [[Quest rewards|quest reward]].\n\n'''NOTE:''' After completing the quest return with a [[rope]] and use it on each eagle to ride them to their destinations and back. This will complete medium tasks in the Fremennik, Desert, and Western Provinces Diaries.

Following this revelation, a workshop was created in Seers' Village, calling all craftsmen to invent new devices using this unique ore. Unfortunately, realising the destructive potential of the ore, the workshop had to be closed down, along with details of any processes involved destroyed.\n[[File:Elemental Workshop I - odd looking wall.png|thumb|220px|The odd looking wall.]]\nRead the book, before using a knife on it to get a [[battered key]], turning the tome into a [[slashed book]]. Do not drop the slashed book. Enter the north building with the anvil icon, and use the key on the odd-looking wall with the strange crack. Climb down the stairs you find there to enter a [[Elemental workshop|workshop]].\n\n===Restarting===\n[[File:Elemental Workshop.png|thumb|left|200px|A map of the [[Elemental workshop|dungeon]].]]\nFirst, head into the northern chamber. There are two water controls to the east and west of the water wheel. Turn both water controls so that they display green instead of red. (If the second valve wheel won't turn green, Turn the first one back to red, then try the second one again.) Then pull the lever near the water wheel to jump-start it. The water wheel should now start spinning.\n[[File:Elemental Workshop I - fixing bellows.png|thumb|220px|A player fixes the bellows.]]\nNext, head into the eastern chamber. Fix the bellows with a spool of thread and leather, then pull the lever next to it.\u00a0The bellows should now start pumping air.\n\nIf you didn't bring your own leather, you can find one in the northwestern crates of the central room. If you didn't bring a needle, it can be found in the crates west of the central room.\n\nHead into the western cavern and attempt to mine an elemental rock. The rock springs to life, yells, and attacks you. Kill the [[earth elemental]], and pick up the [[elemental ore]] that it drops. Kill two more if you want to save time for Elemental Workshop II, or three more if you also want a Mind shield after completing that quest.\n\n'''NOTE:''' One of the [[Kandarin Diary Easy|Kandarin easy]] tasks is to kill 1 of each elemental (must kill a regular Earth elemental, not the ones that can be mined first) but it is entirely optional for this quest.\n[[File:Elemental Workshop I - filling a stone bowl.png|thumb|220px|A player filling a stone bowl with lava.]]\nFinally, head back to the central chamber.

Go to the workshop in the building with the [[anvil]], and let yourself in the same way as in the [[Elemental Workshop I]] [[Quests|quest]]. Go into the northern [[water elemental]] room and search the machinery to the west side of the room. You will receive the key used to unlock the hatch in the main room.\n[[File:Elemental Workshop.png|thumb|240px|A map of the [[Elemental workshop|dungeon]].]]\n:'''Note:''' If you do not read the scroll, you will not get the search option for the machinery.\n:'''Note:''' Before you go down, quickly mine two [[elemental ore]]s (three if you desire a [[mind shield]]) from the west room, and smelt them into [[elemental metal]]s in the south room (you will need 4 coal per elemental bar). Now, head back into the middle of the area, and use the key on the large hatch in the ground.\n\n===Making repairs===\n[[File:Elemental Workshop II - junction pipe placement.png|thumb|190px|Pipe connections]]\nOnce you're downstairs, you need to fix the machinery. First off, search the crate full of [[Crane schematic|crane]] and [[lever schematic]]s to the south, and get one of each. Go back upstairs, and use one of your bars on the workbench. Make the [[crane claw]]. '''Do not make a helmet yet!''' Now, go back down and pull the southwest lever next to the crane, and then use the claw on the crane.\n[[File:Elemental Workshop II - cog placement.png|thumb|190px|Cog placements]]\nNext, head up the small stairs to your west (not up the hatch, but onto the metal construct) to get to the upper level. Open the junction box in the west to work on the pipes for the press (click on the ends you want to connect). You'll want to arrange them as seen on the right.\nFor the next two parts, you'll need to search all the crates in the surrounding area. The items can be in any of the crates either up on the scaffolding (upper level) or down on the level with the crane. You'll need to find a [[Small cog|small]], [[Medium cog|medium]], and [[large cog]], as well as a piece of pipe. Use the pipe on the broken pipe upstairs on the northernmost point of the scaffolding.\n\nThen for the cogs, take them back down the steps to the tunnel on the east side. On the side of the tunnel are three pins. By using the cogs on the machine pins, you want to stick the small one on the upper-left pin, the medium one on the lower left, and the large one on the right.\n\n===Operating the machine===\n[[File:Elemental Workhop II - making primed bar.png|thumb|220px|One of the many steps to creating a primed bar.]]\n#Place your [[elemental metal]] on the jig cart, which should be on the south crane right now.

Go down one more level to where there are two doors, one with the mind symbol and the other with the body symbol. Go into the mind room (nearest), and place your bar on the extractor gun and operate the extractor hat next to it. A part of you will be drained into the bar turning it into a [[Mind bar|primed mind bar]]. This will temporarily lower your [[Magic]] level by 20.\n\nNow, you simply need to pick up the bar from the extractor gun, and go back up to the workshop, and make a [[mind helmet]] out of the bar you just made, and the quest is complete.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Elemental Workshop II\n|image = [[File:Elemental Workshop II reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*7,500 {{Skill clickpic|Smithing}} [[Smithing]] experience\n*7,500 {{Skill clickpic|Crafting}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*The ability to make and use elemental mind equipment.\n**To make a [[mind shield]]: have the [[slashed book]] from the [[Elemental Workshop I]] quest in your inventory, then smith a [[Mind bar|primed mind bar]] into a mind shield.\n}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*When you are downstairs in the corridor that has the mind door, a body door can be seen further down.

Fastest way to get there is by taking a [[magic carpet|carpet]] ride to [[Bedabin Camp]] and running south or through the fairy ring code '''b\u2022i\u2022q''' and running southwest.\n\nFirst, you need 32 kilograms of [[sandstone]]. There is a [[Bandit Camp Quarry|sandstone mine]] next to Lazim that you can use. At a higher [[Mining]] level, you'll get bigger blocks. There are four sizes: 1&nbsp;kg, 2&nbsp;kg, 5&nbsp;kg, and 10&nbsp;kg. You can use your [[chisel]] on big blocks to make them smaller.\n[[File:Building the statue.png|thumb|200px|The statue needs a head.]]\nAfter you've given Lazim exactly 32&nbsp;kg, he will attach them with magic to make a [[sandstone (32kg)|32kg sandstone block]]. Use your chisel on the block that he gives you to make a [[sandstone base]]. Talk to him again, and then use it on the flat ground next to him.\n\nYou now need 20 kilograms of sandstone for the body. After you've given him the required amount and he gives you the [[sandstone (20kg)|20kg sandstone block]], use your chisel on it to make a [[sandstone body]], and then attach it to the base. Use your chisel on the statue to refine it and talk to Lazim again.\n[[File:Completed statue.png|thumb|left|200px|The completed statue.]]\nYou now have to choose the head of the statue. You may choose between any of the two god's heads or Lazim's head. The outcome will always be the same. Mine two 5&nbsp;kg pieces of '''[[granite]], not sandstone!''' Chisel one of the 5&nbsp;kg pieces into a head, and keep the other in your inventory for later in the quest.\n\nUse the head on the statue. It will fall apart, causing you, Lazim, and the statue to fall into an ancient temple. The statue will break. Talk to Lazim, take the silver [[M sigil]] off the pedestal, and use your chisel on the statue to get a [[stone left arm]], [[stone right arm]], [[stone left leg]] and [[stone right leg]], which you'll use as keys to unlock the doors to the rooms.\n[[File:Removing statue parts.png|thumb|200px|Removing the statue parts.]]\nGo around the rooms. Watch the cutscenes of [[Enakhra]] (a Zamorakian [[Mahjarrat]]) and take the [[Z sigil]], [[R sigil]] and [[K sigil]], which together with the M sigil make up the consonants of 'Zamorak'. You may also want to climb the ladders and sandpiles to unlock all four secret entrances. After you've unlocked all of the outer doors with your four limbs, go towards the middle and use the sigil to unlock the door.\n\n====Cutscenes====\n<gallery captionalign=\"left\">\nEnahkhra completes temple.png|Enakhra completes the temple.\nAttempting to kill Enahkhra.png|The Avarrockians attempt to kill Enakhra...\nKnights killed.png|But have failed.\nMeeting Athanakos.png|Athanakos attempts to convert her to the Zarosian side.\nEnakhraandAkthanakos.png|Enakhra tricks Akhanakos that she's changed...\nEnakhra freezes Athanakos.png|And freezes him to become a [[Boneguard]].\nCreating weapons for Zamorak.png|Enakhra's love for Zamorak is endless, and she attempts to create weapons for him.\n</gallery>\n\nUnlock all four doors from the inside, and then go up the ladder. There is a pedestal in the room you are in. Use your [[soft clay]] on the pedestal to make a [[camel mould (p)]] and then use the chisel on the remaining piece of medium-sized [[granite]] (5&nbsp;kg) to make a new [[stone head]]. Place this granite camel head into the pedestal to be greeted by another cut scene. \n\n('''''Optional:''' Use a second wet clay on the granite head on the pedestal to make a camel mask for yourself, but only after you've crafted the new stone head!!'')\n\nThere are four globes that you must light before you proceed north, based on the four classes of the [[Ancient Magic]] spells.\n\n*''Note that players must talk to Lazim before the ice and smoke sections can be completed.''\n\n===Blood===\nTake the north-west corridor and talk to the [[Pentyn|frozen knight]].

Go up the ladder. If you go south, you'll see a [[Boneguard]]. Talk to it, then cast [[Crumble Undead]]. You can now climb over the pile of bones, or search the pile of bones for five [[Big bones]].\n\nClimb down the ladder. You'll see another boneguard. This time, turn on [[Protect from Melee]], and talk to it. It will try to attack you a couple of times\u2014then, it will be impressed. It will tell you that it was put under [[Enakhra]]'s control. Agree to seal her in her temple by building a wall.\n[[File:Wall chiseling.png|thumb|left|200px|Chiselling the wall.]]\n[[File:Athanakos and Enakhra to the North.png|thumb|200px|The Mahjarrat head to the North.]]\nTake three pieces of [[sandstone]] from the pile of bricks, use the sandstone on the wall, and then use your [[chisel]] on the wall to trim it. Once you've built the wall, talk to the boneguard. The boneguard will reveal himself to be another [[Mahjarrat]], [[Akthanakos]]. He follows [[Zaros]] and is Enakhra's archrival.\n\nEnakhra will destroy your wall, and both individuals transform into their true form, the Mahjarrat.

Remember that [[weapons]]/[[armour]] are not allowed on the island.\n\n===Test balloons===\n[[Auguste]] wants to make two test balloons and asks the player to get him the following items:\n*3 [[papyrus]] - can be bought from the [[Tai Bwo Wannai]] or [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]] shops on [[Karamja]], bought from the [[general store]] in [[Ardougne]], bought from [[Ali Morrisane]], or taken from [[Spawning|respawns]] at the [[Legends' Guild]] and [[Yanille]].\n*A [[candle]] - buy from the [[candle seller]] in Tai Bwo Wannai, Shilo Village, or [[Catherby]], or steal one from a table in Entrana's church, taking a maximum of 2 damage if unsuccessful.\n*A [[ball of wool]] - spin from [[wool]] sheared from a [[sheep]], or buy from Ardougne shop or the [[Lletya]] seamstress.\n*A [[Potatoes|sack of potatoes]] - potatoes can be [[Farming|grown]], bought in the shops on [[Miscellania]] and [[Etceteria]], or gathered from [[Lumbridge]], southwest of the mill. Sacks are available from any [[Farming shops|Farming shop]]. Click the sack with 10 potatoes in your [[inventory]] to fill up the sack.\n\n[[File:Enlightened Journey balloon test.png|thumb|250px|An angry mob destroys the balloon.]]\nOnce you have the items, Auguste tells you to make a model of an origami balloon. Use papyrus with the ball of wool, creating a balloon structure, and then use an unlit candle on the balloon structure to get an origami balloon.\u00a0'''Do not light the balloon or else you will have to get the items again!'''\n\nTalk to Auguste to see a short [[cutscene]] of the balloon launch. After that, talk to him again, and he will take the remaining two pieces of papyrus and the sack of potatoes from you. In a second cutscene, the player launches the next balloon, which is attacked by an angry mob of peasants.\n\n===Main balloon===\nNext, [[Auguste]] asks the player to get the materials for a real balloon:\n*[[Yellow dye]] - can be obtained by giving [[Aggie]] in [[Draynor Village]] two [[onion]]s and 5 [[coins]] or can be bought from [[Lletya]] seamstress shop.\n*[[Red dye]] - can be obtained by giving Aggie three [[redberries]] and 5 coins or can be bought from Lletya seamstress shop.\n*10 [[Silk]] - can be bought from the [[silk merchant]] in [[Al Kharid]] at 2-3 coins each, or [[Thieving|stolen]] from the [[Silk stall|stalls]] in [[Ardougne]].\n*A [[bowl]] - can be bought at any [[general store]] or made in [[Barbarian Village]] from [[soft clay]]. There also exists a bowl upstairs in the building directly east of Auguste.\n*8 [[sandbag]]s - Use an [[empty sack]] with a [[sandpit]] (use the one just south of Auguste) to get a sandbag.\n'''''You can skip the following paragraph if you already have willow branches in your bank. '''''After you bring these items (21 in total) to Auguste, he will need to you attach willow branches to the platform. Auguste will give the player a basket of apples and an \"[[Auguste's sapling]]\", which is actually a [[willow sapling]]. Plant the sapling in any [[tree patch]] and ask the local farmer to look after the growing tree by paying with a [[Apples|basket of apples]]. Once it is fully grown, cut 12 [[willow branch]]es from it by using [[secateurs]] to the tree. To save time, you can buy the willow branches from the [[Grand Exchange]].\n\nGive the dyes, pieces of silk, bowl, and sandbags to Auguste in the same trip. Teleport to a bank and take out the 12 willow branches, 10 normal logs, and tinderbox. Head back to Auguste and use the 12 willow branches on the frame of the balloon to weave a basket.\n\n===Fuel===\nTen [[Logs|normal logs]] (other log types '''will not work''') and a [[tinderbox]] are needed for completing the journey. Because [[axe]]s can be wielded as a weapon, they are not allowed on [[Entrana]]. Logs should be prepared ''before'' going to Entrana.\n\n===Ballooning===\n[[File:Balloon controls.png|thumb|250px|The ballooning interface.]]\nAfter giving the materials to [[Auguste]], weaving the basket and having the [[logs]] and [[tinderbox]] in the [[inventory]], speak to Auguste to get ready to fly. He'll describe some of what the player should notice and some tips on how to fly the balloon.\n\nAn interface to control the balloon will appear. Manoeuvre through the obstacle course without hitting ''anything'' (including birds, trees, houses and clouds) and safely ''land'' on the well marked landing spot on the third screen.\n\n====Balloon control panel====\n[[File:Balloon controls panel.png|frame|Balloon controls panel]]\nClicking any control advances the balloon one \"space\" to the right.\n*The top button (drop sandbag) moves the balloon two spaces up ('''UP 2''').\n*The next button (use log) moves the balloon one space up ('''UP 1''').\n*\"Relax\" advances the balloon to the right without changing altitude ('''RIGHT''').\n*The normal rope lowers the balloon by one space ('''DOWN 1'''),\n*The red rope lowers the balloon by two spaces ('''DOWN 2''').\n*Clicking \"Bail\" will cancel the flight.\n\nThe numbers at the side of sack and log buttons correspond to how many times player can use the resources respectively; therefore, fuel is limited. If the player runs out of fuel, they can still \"relax\" or lower altitude (by pulling ropes).\n\nA tip is that ''how'' the balloon appears to travel is not as important as ''where'' it will end up. If the balloon meets a cloud right above it and a bird in front of it, it is possible to go right through both obstacles by dropping sacks or pulling the red rope (raising and dropping the balloon by 2 spaces respectively). The balloon will fly high or low enough to avoid the bird, and will advance one space forward to avoid the cloud. It might not ''seem'' like the balloon can fit through, but it ''can''.\n\n===Flying to Taverley===\n:'''Tip:''' If you happen to crash, just log out and back in. Don't forget to bring 10 more normal logs to retry.\n\nWhen ready to fly, three screens showing the path to [[Taverley]] will appear in the ballooning interface. Go [[Balloon transport system|here]] for more pictures.\n\n'''The balloon should end up one space above the landing pad, with no air space in between'''. Flying past the landing pad would get the balloon blown away, and getting the balloon in the space with landing pad would cause it to smash to the ground\u2014in both cases, the flight would be considered unsuccessful. The player needs to restart the flight by preparing the [[logs]] and [[tinderbox]] again before going to [[Entrana]], although they don't have to rebuild the balloon.\n\nThere are various ways to control the balloon, and the following is just one of the ''suggested'' paths:\n\n====Taverley screen 1====\n[[File:Balloon taverley 1 path.png|frame|centre]]\n:Drop sandbag, Burn log, Relax (x9), Pull <font color=\"Red\">RED</font> rope, Relax (2x), Pull normal rope 1, Relax (x5)\n\n====Taverley screen 2====\n[[File:Balloon taverley 2 path.png|frame|centre]]\n:Burn log, Relax, Burn log, Relax (x10), Burn log, Relax (x5)\n\n====Taverley screen 3====\n[[File:Balloon taverley 3 path.png|frame|centre]]\n:Relax (x7), Pull <font color=\"Red\">RED</font> rope, Pull normal rope, Relax (x3), Burn log, Relax (x4), Pull normal rope\n\nAfter the balloon has landed, talk to [[Auguste]] for a little dialogue - then, the quest is finished.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Enlightened Journey\n|image = [[File:Enlightened Journey reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{Skill clickpic|Crafting|2,000}} [[Crafting]] [[experience]]\n*{{Skill clickpic|Farming|3,000}} [[Farming]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Woodcutting|1,500}} [[Woodcutting]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Firemaking|4,000}} [[Firemaking]] experience\n*The [[Bomber jacket]] and [[Bomber cap|cap]]\n**[[Gnome goggles]] from the [[Gnome Restaurant]] [[Minigames|minigame]] can be combined with the bomber cap by talking with [[Auguste]]\n*Access to the [[balloon transport system]]\n*Ability to make [[origami balloon]]s\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Enlightened Journey is required for the following:\n*[[Monkey Madness II]] (also requires the [[Grand Tree]] destination for the [[balloon transport system]])\n*[[Ardougne Diary|Ardougne Achievement Diary]] (Medium)\n*[[Varrock Diary|Varrock Achievement Diary]] (Medium)\n\n{{Enlightened Journey}}\n\n[[Category:Quests]]"], "Ernest the Chicken": ["{{External|rs|rsc}}\n{{Floor}}\n{{Has quick guide}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Ernest the Chicken\n|number = 7\n|image = [[File:Ernest the Chicken.png|300px]]\n|members = No\n|release = 21 January [[2001]]\n|update = Newsletter 1\n|series = None\n|difficulty = Novice\n|developer = Paul Gower\n}}\n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Speak to [[Veronica]], just south of [[Draynor Manor]] by the gate.\n|difficulty = Novice\n|description = Veronica is very worried.

Climb up the spiral stairs to the west and to the right of the previous staircase, and talk to [[Professor Oddenstein]], who will explain that Ernest was turned into a chicken when he was helping on an experiment with his 'pouletmorph' machine. However, to change him back, the professor needs parts that were stolen and hidden by the poltergeists in the manor.\n\nYou need to help him find a [[pressure gauge]], a [[rubber tube]], and an [[oil can]], in any order you wish.\n\n===Pressure gauge===\nTo get the pressure gauge, you will need some [[fish food]] and [[poison (item)|poison]]. The fish food is in a blue box; the box can be found on the {{FloorNumber|2}} in the room directly south of the winding staircase used to reach [[Professor Oddenstein]]. To get the poison, you need to go to the small northwestern room on the ground floor just south of the cooking range.\n\nOnce you have obtained both items, use the poison with the fish food to create some [[poisoned fish food]]. Go outside the manor through the east door, and '''grab a spade''' (which is needed to get the rubber tube) located to the west (left) of the exit inside the door; if you don't have one already. Look for the fountain on the southwest corner of the manor. '''''Use''''' the poisoned fish food with the fountain to kill the piranhas, and search the fountain to get the gauge.\n\n===Rubber tube===\n[[File:Ernest the Chicken - Rubber tube.png|thumb|220px|The rubber tube and the skeleton.]] Look for the compost on the west side of the grounds.\u00a0The compost heap is found north from the Belladonna ([[Cave nightshade]] patch), just before a small patch of cabbages. Use a [[spade]] (one can be found in the southeast room on the ground floor, or if you are a member, there is a tool leprechaun right next to the compost heap if you have one stored there) on the compost, and you will get a [[Key (Ernest the Chicken)|key]]. Go back into the manor through the front entrance, and use the key with the door containing the room with the [[skeleton]], and take the [[rubber tube]]. The room is right behind the stairs. When you do so, the skeleton will attack you; you can choose to kill the skeleton or simply dodge its attacks and leave the room.\n\n===Oil can===\nGo to the westernmost room on the ground floor. Search the bookcase on the left(west) side on the wall, to gain access to a secret room. Look for a ladder that leads downwards, and climb down into the basement.

'''Fully finish the dialogue or Hazelmere will not be understood later on. '''Hazelmere is located on the island chain east of [[Yanille]].

Hazelmere will then give you a violet pentagon for the machine.\n[[File:The Eyes of Glouphrie - gnome army council.png|thumb|left|The King and his three advisors in the battlefield]][[File:The Eyes of Glouphrie - Glouphrie's grand illusion.png|thumb|Glouphrie summons holograph tortoises to fool Goblins.]]\n[[File:The Eyes of Glouphrie - Argento dies.png|thumb|left|Argento is dead!]]\n\n===Sabotage===\nGo back and speak to [[Brimstail]] where you will see a shorter cut-scene in which an invisible gnome will sabotage the machine you examined earlier.\n[[File:The Eyes of Glouphrie - Oaknock's damaged machine.png|thumb|right|You need to repair this]]\nCrush your [[mud rune]] with the [[pestle and mortar]], and then use it on the [[bucket of sap]] to create [[magic glue]]. Repair the machine using your [[maple logs]], [[oak logs]] and the glue. You will need to have a [[hammer]] and a [[saw]] in your inventory.\n\nNow, you will have to unlock and restart the machine. For this, you will need more crystal disks\u2014talk to Brimstail to get some from him. You can talk to him multiple times to get more shapes. If you can no longer get disks from Brimstail, drop the disks and talk to him again to get more disks.\n\nTo work this machine, you have to fit crystal disks to the numbers shown. The numbers will be different for everybody; therefore, you have to solve this mostly yourself. This is how it works:\n\nTo the west side is a chart showing the values of each colour.\n\nThe crystal is equal to:\n* Red: 1\n[[File:The Eyes of Glouphrie - colour-shape values.png|thumb|400px|The values of each shape and colour.]]\n* Orange: 2\n* Yellow: 3\n* Green: 4\n* Blue: 5\n* Indigo: 6\n* Violet: 7\n\nThis value is multiplied by the number of sides each crystal has\n* Circle has 1 side.\n* Triangle has 3 sides.\n* Square has 4 sides.\n* Pentagon has 5 sides.\n\n* Example 1: a 4 can be a red square or a green circle (1 * 4)\n* Example 2: a 7 can only be a violet circle (7 * 1)\n* Example 3: a 12 can be a green triangle or a yellow square (4 * 3)\n\nSome of the colours can be easily mixed up, since they are very similar (e.g. blue, indigo and violet). Hover them with your mouse to be sure.\n\nThere is a token exchanger on the right-hand side, which allows you to insert various tokens and change them for others of the same value. <u>You cannot exchange more than 35 points worth at a time</u>, but you may exchange a single token for many other lower valued tokens if its value is high enough. You will always receive the same value back, in different tokens.\n\n[[File:The Eyes of Glouphrie - token exchanger interface.png|thumb|right|Token exchanger]]\n\nTo ''unlock'' the machine, you have to create a single disk worth the number of points shown on [[Oaknock the Engineer|Oaknock's]] machine. The numbers are different for everyone. As a general strategy, try and get the smaller numbers and it's easier.

You can pass the time by talking to the [[Cosmic Being]] who lives there, contemplating the mysteries of the universe.\n\nPick a star flower when ready (49 [[Farming]] needed), and add your harvest to the [[vial of water]] (57 [[Herblore]] needed\u2014however, if you are boosting, wait until you have the [[gorak claw powder]] because you need 57 Herblore to finish the potion).\n\n====Gorak claws====\nReturn to [[Zanaris]], and withdraw any [[armour]] and [[weapons]], along with around 10 pieces of good [[food]]. Goraks are '''very''' accurate, so take the best [[Armour/Melee armour|melee armour]] you have. They are aggressive, but luckily, they are not located in a [[multicombat area]], therefore you can only fight one at at time. However, by remaining in the fairy ring, they will not be aggressive until they are attacked.[[File:Gorak safe spot 1.png|thumb|212x212px|A player safespotting the goraks]]\n:* '''Note:''' that [[protection prayers]] do not work against [[gorak]]s, but you may use boosting prayers.\n\n:* '''Additional note:''' It is possible to safespot the goraks (see picture). It may prove a bit difficult, since they are aggressive, so be extra careful if you are low levelled.\n\nAt the Zanaris [[fairy ring]], use the sequence {{fairycode|DIR}} to get to another plane full of goraks. You must have the [[Nuff's certificate|certificate]] in your inventory for this to work! They are level 145 or 149 and occasionally drain stat points. Kill them, eating food when necessary and drink [[restore potion]]s if needed until you get a [[Gorak claws|gorak claw]]. To leave, equip your staff of choice and teleport to Zanaris using the right-click option on the fairy ring. Crush the claw with a [[pestle and mortar]] to get [[gorak claw powder]].\n\n===The final scene===\nMix the [[star flower]] and [[gorak claw powder]] into a [[vial of water]] to make a [[magic essence]] potion (57 [[Herblore]] needed). Return to the [[Fairy Resistance Hideout|Resistance Hideout]], use a dose of the magic essence potion on the [[Fairy Queen|queen]], who finally regains her senses. \n[[File:Curing Fairy Queen.gif|frame|The player uses the magic essence on the Queen, saving her life!]]\nAs the queen angrily prepares to return to [[Zanaris]] and take back her throne, [[Fairy Very Wise]] and [[Fairy Nuff]] remind her that the [[Fairy Godfather]] has thugs and [[ork]]s at his disposal. His \"army\" has her easily outclassed, compared to her Majesty's small band of loyalists (many of whom are injured).

He'll tell you about how without his family's crest, he can't prove his heritage and take back his estate. His sons took the crest when they left, and he doesn't know where they all are, though last he heard, [[Caleb]] was working as a chef in [[Catherby]].\n\n===Caleb===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Shrimps]], [[bass]], [[salmon]], [[tuna]] and a [[swordfish]] (all cooked).''\n\nHead to [[Catherby]]. Near the middle of town (south-west of the [[Farming shop]]), usually inside the building with the sink, though he wanders outside sometimes, is [[Caleb]]. Talk to him, and he'll say his brothers and he accidentally broke the crest into three [[Crest part|parts]] and each of them ended up with a piece. Luckily, he still has his piece, though he's not going to just hand it over to any passing stranger. He has an important event coming up, and he needs some fish for a special salad. Get them for him, and he'll give you the piece of the crest. What you need is [[shrimp]], [[salmon]], [[tuna]], [[bass]], and [[swordfish]] all cooked. All but the salmon can be fished right there in Catherby. The salmon can be caught in a lake just a little north of the bank in the nearby town of [[Seers' Village]]. Once you have all of that, give it to him and he'll give you the piece as promised, along with a little bit of info. He'll say that the [[gem trader]] in [[Al Kharid]] might know more about the location of [[Avan]].\n:'''Important:''' Make sure he tells you about the other missing pieces. If he doesn't, the gem trader will not have the right dialogue options, and you will have to talk to Caleb once again. It is necessary to talk to Caleb again immediately after receiving the piece of the crest to ask him where the other pieces are.\n:'''Note:''' Low level [[Ironman]] accounts without access to the [[Warriors' Guild]] will need 46 [[Fishing]] as a requirement in order to catch a [[raw bass]] and 43 [[Cooking]] to cook it.\n\n===Avan===\n'''''Items required:''' [[necklace mould]], [[ring mould]], any [[pickaxe]], 2 [[Ruby|cut rubies]], [[food]] (optional), [[armour]] (optional) and a method to get to [[Falador]] and [[Ardougne]] (optional but will save running).''\n\nWhen you talk to the [[gem trader]] in [[Al Kharid]], he will remember the person you're looking for, direct you north towards the [[gold rock]]s in a pit in the desert. Head there and talk to the man wandering around just at the entrance to the pit with a yellow [[cape]] on. This is, indeed, [[Avan]], as he'll tell you when you ask him. He's not giving up his piece of the crest though unless you can help him win the affection of a certain lady by getting him a [['perfect' ring|ring]] and [['perfect' necklace|necklace]] made out of perfect gold. Unfortunately, the stuff there in the desert isn't nearly good enough. He'll tell you a [[dwarf]] named\u00a0[[Boot (NPC)|Boot]] might know something about where to find the gold.\n[[File:Dwarven Mine map.png|thumb|200px|[[Boot (NPC)|Boot]] is located towards the far west end of [[Dwarven Mine]].]]\n\nMake your way to [[Falador]] (alternatively, use a [[combat bracelet]] to teleport to the [[Edgeville Monastery]], or a [[skills necklace]] to the [[Mining Guild]]) and go into [[Dwarven Mines]]. Once inside, go south-west (from the Northern Entrance) \u2014 see the map to the right. Boot should be wandering around down there, in the second alcove. Talk to him and ask him about perfect gold. He'll come up with a likely location. It's a small [[Witchaven Shrine|dungeon]] just between [[Ardougne]] and [[Witchaven]]. You've already been there if you've done the [[Slug Menace]] quest.\n\nTeleport or run to Ardougne. Run east of Ardougne, just outside of the wall next to Witchhaven. Make sure to get your [[pickaxe]], food and some gear, as there are a bunch of level 28\u00a0[[hobgoblin]]s, level 53 [[ogre]]s, and level 122 [[hellhound]]s that you'll have to either fight or avoid. It is possible to mine the [[Perfect ore|ores]] without combat; however, you will probably be attacked.\n\n'''Note:''' [[Protect from Melee]] is very useful here, since combat does not interrupt mining (despite visually interrupting the animation).\n\nInside the cave, to the south will be a small caged area with several hellhounds inside, along with the gold rocks you need to mine. To the north and south are two rooms with levers in and outside of them. You'll have to do a little bit of a lever puzzle here to open the gate to the hellhounds.\n[[File:Family Crest - Witchaven Dungeon levers.png|thumb|The sequence of operating the levers to get perfect gold.]]\n\n#Go to the northern wall and pull the lever up.\n#Head into the southern room and pull the lever up.\n#Go back to the northern wall and pull the lever down.\n#Go inside the northern room and pull the lever up.\n#Leave the room and pull the lever on the northern wall up.\n#Go back to the southern room and pull the lever down.\n#The hellhound room should now be unlocked.\n#Mine at least two [[perfect gold ore]] and get out.\n\nNow, get your [[rubies]], your [[ring mould]], and your [[necklace mould]] and go to any [[furnace]] that's handy (perhaps the one in [[Al Kharid]]). Smelt the ore into [[perfect gold bar]]s and then use the resulting 'perfect' bars on the furnace again, selecting the usual ruby ring and and ruby necklace options to make the [[perfect ruby ring]] and [[perfect ruby necklace]] (if you just make gold jewellery, they will not be 'perfect'). Once you have the items, head back to Al Kharid and give them to Avan. As a reward, he'll give you the second piece of the crest and will tell you how to find his brother.\n\n===Johnathon===\n'''''Items required:''' An [[antipoison]] potion, [[runes]] and [[Wizard's mind bomb]]/[[magic potion]] (if boosting).

Bring your [[antipoison potion]], and head up to the {{FloorNumber|2}} where he is huddled in a room. Talk to him; he'll tell you he got bitten by a [[Poison spider|poisonous spider]]. Give him the antipoison (he'll take the entire potion, not one dose) and he'll be very grateful and be able to relay to you what happened. Apparently, he got cocky and decided he wanted to try to kill a powerful demon named [[Chronozon]]. The demon sent him away and in the process stole the last piece of the crest. If you want it back, you'll have to finish what [[Johnathon]] started.\n:<span style=\"color:red\">'''Warning:'''</span> You will be heading into the [[Wilderness]]. The [[chaos druids]] are a popular [[player killing]] spot.\n[[File:Family Crest - Chronozon safe spot.png|thumb|220px|Chronozon safe spot.]]\n[[Chronozon]] can be found near the poison spiders in the [[Edgeville Dungeon]]. You'll need to bring food, armour, an antipoison potion for the poison spiders, and enough [[runes]] to cast each [[Blast spells|elemental blast spell]] at least once. It will probably take more than one casting, especially if you're lower level, because if the spell just \"splashes\" on Chronozon, it doesn't count. You have to actually ''hit'' Chronozon with a [[Wind Blast]], [[Water Blast]], [[Earth Blast]], and [[Fire Blast]]. When you hit him with all of those spells, it will weaken him and make him a little easier. Afterwards, he may be killed with any [[combat class]].\n:'''Note:''' When a cast of [[Wind Blast]], [[Water Blast]], [[Earth Blast]], and [[Fire Blast]] is successful in weakening [[Chronozon]], text will appear in the chatbox stating \"''Chronozon weakens....''\".\n\nIf you don't get all of the spells to successfully hit, though, he '''won't''' die. When you finally do kill him, grab the crest piece and head out of there. It is also wise to take a one-click teleport, such as the [[Varrock teleport|Varrock teletab]], to teleport out of the dungeon immediately following Chronozon's defeat.\n\n===The crest reassembled===\nNow that you have all three crest pieces, put them together to make the [[family crest (item)|Family Crest]] and then make your way back to [[Varrock]].

On trying to enter the prison, the door is locked, though the guards mistake the player as a [[Khazard Guard]] and let him in, as long as the player is wearing the Khazard armour retrieved earlier. While inside, unequipping the Khazard armour results in being booted from the jail by the Khazard guards.

Talk to the guard, and you will find out that that he wants a decent drink, [[Khali brew]], to be exact. He will also tell you that if he had too much, he would fall asleep. Be careful not to attack him by accident or you will need to wait for him to [[Spawning|respawn]] again or get far enough to make him lose his aggression on you. (If you do attack the guard, you can go up the nearby staircase and back down to reset the guard's aggression)\n\n'''You must talk to the guard before purchasing the brew, or the bartender will not offer it.'''\n\nThe only bar that sells the brew is the one southwest of the western entrance to the jail.

A great way to get there is by using the [[Minigame Group Finder]] teleport to [[Blast Furnace]]. Another great way is to use the cart trapdoor in the north-western part of [[Grand Exchange]]. The [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|dks}}\u00a0will bring you right next to the entrance to Keldagrim. There are also cart rides from the [[Dwarven Mine]], the underground [[White Wolf Mountain]] passageway, and [[Dorgesh-Kaan]] (if you completed the quest [[Another Slice of H.A.M.]]).\n\nTo start this quest, talk to [[Veldaban]], Commander of the [[Dwarven Black Guard|Black Guard]] in the Black Guard H.Q., west of the Keldagrim bank. He is rather shocked to tell you that, after the incident at the end of [[The Giant Dwarf]], the [[Red Axe]] company has left Keldagrim and will soon be kicked out of the [[Consortium]].\n\nHowever, he finds it rather suspicious and wants you to investigate the mining group. The only lead they have currently, is a [[Drunken Dwarf (Keldagrim)|dwarf]] living in east Keldagrim who expresses strange behaviour when the company is mentioned.\n\nAgree to help Veldaban, and you will automatically be transported to the dwarf's house in east Keldagrim after a short cutscene. Speak to the dwarf, who is rather drunk and will ask you for a drink. Talk to him to give him the beer. Beer can be bought in the [[Laughing Miner Pub|Laughing Miner]] or the [[King's Axe Inn]] for two coins. He, however, wants \"some of the REALLY good stuff\", which is an incredibly alcoholic drink called [[Kelda stout]].\n\n===Getting the seeds===\n'''''Items required:''' Random item (see below), 201 [[coins]], [[dwarven stout]] (obtainable for free), and a [[beer]] (purchasable for 1 coin)''\n\nTo make the drink, you need to grow some [[kelda hops]] from 4 [[kelda seed]]s, possessed by some of his drunken friends - namely [[Khorvak]], [[Gauss]] and the [[rowdy dwarf]].\n[[File:Forgettable Tale toast.png|200px|thumb|Cheers!]]\n* The [[Drunken Dwarf (Keldagrim)|drunken dwarf]] gives the first seed to set you off.\n* For the next seed, go to the [[Laughing Miner]] pub (directly south of the drunken dwarf's house) and you should see the [[Rowdy dwarf]], circling around the pub. He asks you for a random item in exchange for another seed. See the list of items and how to obtain them below. Before teleporting outside of Keldagrim to obtain whatever item you're asked for (if needed), proceed to obtaining the next seed.\n* For the third seed, go to the west side of [[Keldagrim]] and talk to\u00a0[[Gauss]]. He is in the\u00a0[[King's Axe Inn]],\u00a0south of the bank in west Keldagrim. He will ask you to do a toast with him. Buy a beer and talk to him again to get the seed. After toasting him you can click off him and still get the seed without drinking the beer saving it for later.\n* To get the next seed, go to the [[White Wolf Mountain]] by using the [[mine cart]]s. In the pub, talk to [[Khorvak, a dwarven engineer]]. Take a dwarven stout off the table, and give it to Khorvak to get the seed - or just talk him out of it. You \"borrow\" the seed as you manage to convince him that you will \"return it\"..\n\n{| class=\"mw-collapsible\" style=\"text-align:left;\" mw-collapsed \"\n!A list of the items the Rowdy Dwarf may ask you for\n|-\n|'''Note:''' For the bucket of \"camel poo\", you need a [[Camulet]], a quest reward from [[Enakhra's Lament]]. If you haven't done this quest, you just have to log out and log in again (or wait a few minutes). The other way is to ask the [[Pollnivneach]] [[kebab seller]] for some [[hot sauce]], pour it into the camel feed west of the bar, and use a [[bucket]] on the camel dung that drops after a few seconds. For other items, if you talk to the rowdy dwarf later, you can select the option that you don't know where to get the item, and he'll ask you to get another item.\n<br />Random items include:\n* An [[amulet mould]] - [[Dommik's Crafting Store|Al-Kharid Crafting Store]], south of the [[Duel Arena]].\n* An acne [[potion]] - [[Varrock]] [[apothecary]]. Ask him for a free potion. You may have to ask for it several times.\n* An [[anchovy pizza]] - Bought from other players, or made with the [[Cooking]] skill.\n* [[Ashes]] - Burn any [[log]] and collect the ashes.\n* A [[banana]] - Found in [[Karamja]] Plantation - use an [[amulet of glory]] teleport, or use the [[Bones to Bananas]] spell.\n* [[Bat bones]] - Found in various locations, such as south of [[Seers' Village]].\n* [[Broken glass]] - Found north of [[Laughing Miner Pub]] where you talk to the Drunken Dwarf.\n* A burnt [[chicken]] - Either fail at cooking a [[chicken]], or use a [[cooked chicken]] on a [[range]] or [[fire]].\n* A [[cabbage]] - Found north-west of [[Draynor Village]]. If you have [[Explorer's ring 3]], you can teleport to the cabbage patch. He will <u>'''''not'' accept'''</u> the special [[Cabbage (Draynor Manor)|Draynor Manor variety]].\n* An [[eye patch]] - Any [[trader crewmember]] next to the [[charter ship]]s.

Dropped from [[barbarian]]s and [[imp]]s, or a random gift from talking to [[man]] (level 2) (Rare) '''Note:''' An ''Al Kharid'' flyer '''<u>will not</u>''' be accepted.\n* A pink [[skirt]] - Can be purchased from [[Thessalia's Fine Clothes]] by the central square in [[Varrock]] for 2 coins.\n* A [[potato]] - Can be picked in the fields north of [[East Ardougne]], near Lumbridge, or player-grown.\n* A red [[cape]] - Can be purchased from [[Thessalia's Fine Clothes]] by the central square in [[Varrock]] for 2 coins.\n* Some [[studded chaps]] - Made with the [[Crafting]] skill or bought.\n* A [[toy horsey]] - Bought from [[Diango]] in [[Draynor]] Market or made on the [[Crafting table]] in a [[Player-owned house]] using a regular [[plank]].\n* [[Vampyre dust]] - [[Vampyre]]s are found in the [[Haunted Woods]], east of [[Canifis]].\n* A [[spinning plate]] - Bought from [[Diango]] in [[Draynor]] Market.\n* A bucket of \"camel poo\" - Use a [[Camulet]] and a bucket and ask a [[camel]] for its dung in [[Al-Kharid]], or use a bottle of [[hot sauce]] from the [[Pollnivneach]] [[kebab seller]] with camel feed west of [[The Asp & Snake Bar]] and use a [[bucket]] on the dung.\n* A [[king worm]] - Obtained in the north part of [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]]; [[Taverley]].\n* [[Swamp tar]] - Obtained in [[Lumbridge Swamp]] or [[Morytania]], the latter is not recommended.\n* A [[white apron]] - [[Port Sarim]] Fishing shop, on the north wall.\n* A [[steel dart]] - Player-made after [[The Tourist Trap]] or bought.\n* A [[bronze scimitar]] - Player-made or\u00a0bought in [[Zeke's Superior Scimitars|Al-Kharid Scimitar Shop]].\n|}\n\n===Brewing===\n'''''Items required:''' 4 [[kelda seed]]s, [[rake]] (obtainable for free), [[seed dibber]], [[spade]], 2 [[Bucket of water|buckets of water]], 2 [[barley malt]], [[pot]] (obtainable for free), 25 [[coins]], [[beer glass]]''\n\n[[File:Kelda hops grown.png|thumb|Harvesting the Kelda hops]]\nOnce you have all the four seeds, go to the hops farming plot in front of the palace in West [[Keldagrim]] and east of the bank. Ask [[Rind the gardener]] for advice on planting the seeds there, and he tells you that for some reason, sunlight is harmful for kelda seeds and hence you can only grow it underground. He then gives you permission to use the [[Kelda hops]] patch.\n\nWeed the garden using a rake, plant the hops, and wait 15-20 (likely around 18) minutes. You don't have to be online, but you'll get a notification when the hops are ready saying: ''Perhaps I should take a look and see if my Kelda hops have grown...'' The hops don't require attention or water and cannot get diseased, as they are known for having a remarkably fast growing speed.\n\nIf you need something to pass the time, you can talk to Rind the gardener and deliver a [[Letter (Forgettable Tale...)|letter]] for him; you must take it to [[Elstan]], the gardener at the allotment south of [[Falador]] (you can quickly reach him using the cabbage port from the [[Explorer's ring]]\u00a02, 3, or 4), then go back to Keldagrim to Rind to get two [[marrentill seed]]s.\n\nWhen your seeds have grown, pick the Kelda hops.\n\nYou now need to head to the bar in East Keldagrim and up the stairs to the [[fermenting vat]]. '''The vat at Port Phasmatys cannot be used'''; the vat will give the message, \"These special hops need to be brewed in the Keldagrim brewery. Oh well...\" If you already have contents in the fermenting vat bring 8 beer glasses or 2 calquat kegs to empty them. If the contents are still fermenting you can drain the vat by using the valve (whatever contents were fermenting in this vat will be lost).\n\nIf ready to brew the ale, use two [[bucket of water|buckets of water]] on the vat, then add two [[barley malt]], then the [[kelda hops]]. Take the [[pot]] from the nearby table if you don't already have one and ask [[Blandebir]] to fill it up with [[ale yeast]] for 25gp. Use the [[ale yeast]] on the vat and the fermenting process will begin. This will take another 15\u201320 (likely 18) minutes and you will get a notification when it's ready.\n\nWhen it's done fermenting, turn the valve and use a [[beer glass]] on the barrel. Head to the [[Drunken Dwarf (Keldagrim)|Drunken Dwarf]]'s house just north and talk about the [[Red Axe]]. He will ask for the [[Kelda stout]] and then tell you about the boarded up tunnel along with a small cutscene.\n\n===Exploring the closed tunnel===\n'''''Items required:''' None''\n\n[[File:Cart Conductor.png|thumb|left|200px|Cart Conductor and the blocked passage]]\nTalk to the [[cart conductor]] to the south at the train cart tracks (only one of the conductors will give you the option to ask about the closed off tunnel - see screenshot). Now, talk to the director of the mining company that you joined during [[The Giant Dwarf]] quest, which is located upstairs in either the west or the east marketplace. Ask them for help with the boarded up tunnel, and they will have the boards removed at once. Go back to the conductor and ride the cart that goes into the new tunnel (the most southern cart, no ticket required).\n\nYou will find yourself before a gigantic abyss at the end of the cart ride. A short cutscene shows the vastness of the area, along with tracks floating out in all directions. \n\n''If you log out at anytime while in the cave, you will be transported out in the city, and your progress will be saved.''\n\n====Room 1====\nTo proceed, you will need to head through one of the many exits on the other side of the chasm. First, you need to solve a puzzle to set the tracks to the exit. Collect the [[square stone]]s from the box next to the controls, and set them in the dwarven machinery. A green stone will make the cart take the top path at a junction, and a yellow stone will make it take the bottom path.\n\nYour goal is to set up a connection between the red square all the way to the left and the boxes that are to the right. To place/rotate a stone in a junction, click '''''once''''' for green, '''''twice''''' for yellow, and '''''three times''''' to remove the stone. The green line shows the path the cart will take.\n\n# To get past this room, operate the controls and place the '''yellow''' stone on the farthest spot to the left and the '''green''' stone one spot below that, as shown below. Hop onto the cart, and search the box on the platform that you reach to obtain another green [[square stone]]. Take the cart back to the control box.\n# There are two ways to go forward with the next one: either '''green, yellow, green''' or '''green, green, yellow'''. Ride the cart again, search the box for a second yellow stone, and return to the control box.\n# Finally, connect the stones to the red cross, with the '''two yellow''' blocks on the left hand side and '''two green''' blocks on the right hand side. Ride the cart to reach the second room.\n\n<gallery captionalign=\"center\" position=\"center\">\nForgettable Tale - cart 1-1.png|Part 1\nForgettable Tale - cart 1-2.png|Part 2\nForgettable Tale - cart 1-3.png|Part 3\n</gallery>\n\n====Room 2====\n[[File:Forgettable Tale - eavesdropping.png|thumb|200px|Overhearing an important conversation...]]\nIn this room, you eavesdrop on a conversation between [[Hreidmar]] (the Red Axe Director), an [[Grunsh|Ogre Shaman]], and a [[Colonel Grimsson|Red Axe Henchman]] discussing their plans. You learn that [[The Red Axe]] bribed the boatman into deliberately crashing into the statue so that they could blame it on a human in [[The Giant Dwarf]] quest. Crawl through the hole at the opposite end of the room from where you entered.\n\n====Room 3====\nYou'll now be in another mine cart abyss. Search the box to receive two yellow and one green stone.\n\n# Put the '''green''' stone on the far left, a '''yellow''' one above it, and another '''yellow''' one to the right. Ride the cart, search the box, and ride back.\n# Put a '''yellow''' stone at the far left, another '''yellow''' one spot below that, a '''green''' one below that, and another '''green''' to the right.

Search the three crates. One contains papers concerning statistical data, salary structures, and shopping lists. The other two, however, are much more interesting. '''YOU MUST ALSO SEARCH A BOOKCASE BEFORE MOVING ON.'''\n\n*There is a copy of a letter addressed to the dwarven boatman, signed by [[Colonel Grimsson]]. It speaks of the bribe, which was part of the plans you overheard earlier, so that the boatman takes along some gullible human on his boat to blame and destroy the statue of King Alvis:\n\n{{Cquote2|\n<center> I am writing to advise you that our secret preparations to the statue have been completed. All you need to do now is hit it with your boat. Take some gullible human along when you do, the mines are crawling with them these days. The human will surely get the major blame.</center>\n\n<center> After this, the statue is going to be rebuilt in the image of our great director. You need not concern yourself with the how and why, but rest assured you will be compensated greatly.</center>|Regards, Colonel Grimsson of the Red Axe}}\n*The other letter is a report on an exploring dwarf who entered the mines - your new buddy, the [[Drunken Dwarf (Keldagrim)|drunken dwarf]] - whose memory was wiped to avoid any risk:\n\n{{Cquote2|Report on Intruder\n\n\nWe found a dwarf wandering in our mines. We weren't sure if he was a spy or simply an explorer, but we couldn't take any risks. We decided to send him back with his memory wiped, rather than put him to use as one of our test subjects. We can't afford having to explain another mysterious disappearance at this point. Additionally, we added something to the spell that would make him hungry for kebabs and thirsty for beer, so that whatever he can remember will be dismissed as the ravings of a drunken fool. Grunsh did a good job, he seems to be fitting in well. Nevertheless, the spell seems to have been a little bit too strong, the subject is unlikely to recover from his condition. His obsession with kebabs is a bit too extreme. Will tell Grunsh to adjust his spell next time.}}\n\n*One of the books in the bookcases contains information on [[Red Axe]] employees, in particular Colonel Grimsson and [[Grunsh]], the Red Axe Henchman and ogre shaman encountered earlier:\n\n{{Cquote2|Red Axe Employee Records\n\n\nHreidmar, director of the Red Axe (employee #1)\n\nInformation classified.\n\nGrimsson, the butcher of Barendir (employee #4297)\n\nGrimsson was once a soldier in the dwarven army and quickly made his way up the ranks, up to colonel. He served with the Black Guard at Ice Mountain and in Kandarin. He was present at the battle of Barendir when he fought against an army of trolls. It was here that he got his nickname, the Butcher of Barendir, as he mercilessly killed the trolls even as they retreated in defeat. Here, also, he got his distinctive scar running across his forehead in a hand-to-hand battle with a particularly ferocious troll. After this battle Grimsson became more and more aggressive, even to his fellow dwarves. Following a particularly vicious attack on a comrade, he was dismissed from the Black Guard. Soon after, he was recruited by the Red Axe. Here he's learned to control his rage and become even stronger. By now, he has become the right hand dwarf of the director. While he holds no official rank, he is still often affectionately referred to as 'The Colonel'.\n\nGrunsh, Ogre Shaman (employee #38262)\n\nFound lost and near death in the ice cold mountains above Keldagrim, Grunsh was nearly mistaken for a troll at first. Taken in by the Red Axe and nursed back to health, it turned out that he was in fact a powerful ogre shaman. Intelligent by ogre standards, and steadfastly loyal to his rescuers, he has taken up a prominent position in the ranks of the Red Axe. This is primarily due to the fact that since dwarves cannot use magic, they must rely on other races as spellcasters. Grunsh fits the bill perfectly.}}\n\n====Room 5====\nMoving forward from the reports room, you arrive at the final chasm. Search the box for two yellow and two green stones.\n\n# Put a '''green''' stone on the far left, a '''green''' stone one above that, a '''yellow''' stone one above that, and a '''yellow''' one to the right. Ride, search, and ride back.\n# Put a '''yellow''' stone on the far left, another '''yellow''' one below that, another '''yellow''' one below that, a '''green''' to the right, a '''green''' above that, and another '''green''' above that.

Be careful, if you have more than one ring of charos in your inventory, the others will disappear. He will tell a story about [[Queen Ellamaria]] before she was married to [[King Roald]], as well as the origin of the ring of charos. Give the ring to the Wise Old Man, after which he will ask seven questions to test whether the player is capable for the possession of an activated ring. Note that if you answer the first six questions correctly, the seventh question can be answered in any way. The questions are below, with the correct answers in bold:\n\n1/7: Two goblins are fighting over the colour of their armour. What do you do?\n*Leave them to it. Armour's not going to help - any noob could take them.\n*Kill them both and steal their bronze spears.\n*'''Show them a range of colours so that they can come to a compromise.'''\n2/7: A Drunken dwarf offers you a kebab. What do you do?\n*Run away leaving the lonely dwarf on its own.\n*Stand there until he gets annoyed and attacks you.\n*'''Take his generous gift even though you have no need for it.'''\n3/7: Are you enjoying your experience of Farming?\n*Yes.\n*Definitely.\n*'''It's absolutely, unquestionably the most interesting thing I've ever done!'''\n\n4/7: A dwarf asks you to put on a silly golden helmet so that you can be fired from a cannon into a wall. What do you do?\n*Refuse this crazy request blankly.\n*Put the helmet on the dwarf and fire him into the wall.\n*'''Put on the silly helmet and jump into the cannon.'''\n\n5/7: You meet Pkmaster0036 in the wilderness who asks you who is the greatest player killer in the world. How do you answer?\n*Cower in fear and quickly cast teleport to Varrock.\n*I am, prepare to meet your doom Pkmaster0036!\n*'''You of course Pkmaster0036, no one could ever challenge your greatness!'''\n\n6/7: Queen Ellamaria orders you to go on a foolish quest without any offer of reward. What do you say?\n*Stop ordering me about and get back behind the bar where you belong!\n*I'll do whatever you ask - I just love the monarchy!\n*'''Ask me nicely and I might consider it.'''\n\n7/7: A Draynor bank guard asks you if you've seen any suspicious characters lately, because the bank has been robbed. What do you say?\n*Yes, that wise old man over there looks incredibly dodgy.\n*If I do I'll let you know.\n*'''No, especially not that wise old man, who doesn't look at all suspicious.'''\n\nAfter answering the questions correctly, the Wise Old Man will enchant the ring of charos and return it to the player. The player will need to wear the activated ring (shown as \"ring of charos(a)\") and use the dialog with \"(Charm)\" to persuade most of the [[NPCs]] the queen asked to find.\n\n==Obtaining the seeds==\n:'''Note:''' Players can visit the NPCs in any order. Also, note that when crops you plant for [[Elstan]], [[Lyra]] and [[Kragen]] fully grow, you will receive a message in your chat box. The seeds for these NPCs '''must''' be planted '''after''' talking to them.

'''Agree to his request without using the \"charm\" option.'''\n\nAfter speaking with Elstan, the player must grow marigolds in the nearby [[flower patch]] from seed to flower. In exchange for the harvested marigolds, Elstan will hand over the [[delphinium seed]]s. If you lose these seeds, speak to Elstan again, and he will provide you with more.\n\n===Lyra, farming patch west of Port Phasmatys===\n'''''Items required:''' The [[ring of charos(a)]], [[#Farming equipment|farming equipment]], 3 [[onion seed]]<nowiki/>s''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' [[Compost]]/[[supercompost]]/[[ultracompost]], the [[Ectophial]] or [[Dramen staff|Dramen]]/[[Lunar staff|Lunar]] staff for [[fairy ring]] {{Fairycode|alq}}'' or [[Fenkenstrain's Castle Teleport]] '', and a [[plant cure]].

Water the plantation and while the onions grow, head off and visit another gardener.\n\nWhen the onions are fully grown, speak to Lyra again. She will give you three [[yellow orchid seed]]s and three [[pink orchid seed]]s for your effort.\n\n===Kragen, farming patch north of Ardougne===\n'''''Items required:''' The [[ring of charos(a)]], [[#Farming equipment|farming equipment]], and 3 [[cabbage seed]]s.''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' [[Compost]]/[[supercompost]]/[[ultracompost]] and a [[plant cure]].''\n:'''Note:''' Farming payment will not work for this section.\n\nGo to the [[Farming/Patch locations|farming patch]] north of [[East Ardougne]].

Charm her, and Dantaera will let you cut a branch of the [[white tree]], which is on the top of [[Ice Mountain]] ''(not to be confused with [[White Wolf Mountain]])'', near the [[Oracle]].\n\nAfter talking to Dantaera, the player should prepare a [[filled plant pot]], a pair of [[secateurs]], a [[gardening trowel]] and a [[watering can]] with water.\n\nTeleport to [[Edgeville]] and head west, to the top of Ice Mountain and find the white tree. Use the pair of secateurs on the tree, and the player will get a [[white tree shoot]]. Use it on the plant pot with soil (you will need a trowel) and water it. After a while, the branch will grow into a sapling and is ready to be planted in the tree patch in [[Ellamaria]]'s garden in [[Varrock]].\n\n===Brother Althric, Edgeville Monastery===\n'''Players should ''not'' throw away or destroy the ring ''before'' being told by Althric to do so. The steps mentioned in this section should be followed strictly.'''\n\n'''''Items required:''' [[Ring of charos(a)]] and a [[fishing rod]] (optional)''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' An [[amulet of glory]] (for [[Edgeville]] teleport) or [[combat bracelet]] to teleport right to it.''\n\nGo to the garden at the northern side of the [[Edgeville Monastery]], with the [[Ring of charos(a)]] equipped. Try to take the rose seeds, and [[Brother Althric]] will stop the player. Try to charm him, and he will claim the player is wearing an \"evil talisman\" and demands that the player throw it into the well in [[Edgeville]], or simply destroy it. '''Players should ''not'' throw away or destroy the ring ''before'' being told by Althric to do so.'''\n:'''Note:''' It is suggested that the player should go to Edgeville and throw the ring in the local well. Otherwise, the player will have to go to [[Fenkenstrain's Castle]] and pickpocket [[Dr Fenkenstrain]] again in order to recover the ring. He is located at the top floor of the castle.\n[[File:Fishing ring of charos.png|thumb|220px|Fishing back the ring of charos.]]\nWith the ring thrown away or destroyed, players can go to the monastery and attempt to take the seeds again. This time, Brother Althric will be pleased and will allow the player to take the rose seeds. Players need all three kinds of rose seeds - [[red rose seed]]s, [[pink rose seed]]s and [[white rose seed]]s.\n\nIf the player has thrown the ring into the well, the monk will mention a method to recover it. Players should get their own [[Fishing rod|fishing]]/[[fly fishing rod]], ([[oily fishing rod]] and [[barbarian rod]] do not work) and use it with the well in Edgeville. It might take several tries, but the ring can eventually be recovered.\n\n===Bernald, The Toad and Chicken in Burthorpe===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Ring of charos(a)]], a [[Rune essence|rune]]/[[pure essence]], a [[pestle and mortar]], 2 [[plant cure]]s and a [[hammer]].''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' A [[games necklace]] (for teleport).''\n\nGo to [[Burthorpe]] (you can use a [[games necklace]] or the [[Minigame Group Finder]]). Go to the [[Toad and Chicken]] pub, and enter the garden on the eastern side. Talk to [[Bernald]] and charm him. He will tell the player that his vines are dying and needs a cure. Use '''''one''''' plant cure on the vine, and you will find it's not working. Talk to Bernald again, and he will instruct you to find [[Alain]] at [[Taverley]].\n\nHead south to the [[tree patch]] in Taverley (near the entrance gate dividing the [[members]] and [[free-to-play]] areas) and speak to Alain. He will provide a method of enhancing the [[plant cure]]'s power. '''Do not use the \"charm\" option in dialogue, or he will refuse to help you.'''\n\nAfter speaking with Alain, use a [[hammer]] on a [[Rune essence|rune]]/[[pure essence]] to crush the stone into [[rune shards]], and then use the [[pestle and mortar]] on the shards to make some [[rune dust]]. Use the dust with the remaining plant cure potion to get a [[Plant cure (Garden of Tranquillity)|strengthened plant cure]]. Bring the potion back to Bernald in Burthorpe, and use it on the diseased vines. The vines will now be cured.\n\nTalk to Bernald, and he will give some Burthorpe [[vine seed]]s. If you lose these seeds, talk to Bernald, and he will provide you with more.\n\n==Getting the statues==\n'''''Recommended:''' A [[Lumbridge teleport|Lumbridge]] and [[Falador teleport]].''\n:'''Note:''' The plants take a while to grow (the white tree being the longest time), so it is recommended to [[#Gardening|do the gardening now]] and to get the statues while the plants are growing.\n\nPlayers can talk to [[Ellamaria]] and ask about getting the statues. She will provide a [[trolley]] for the player to push or pull the statues.\n\nWhen there is a statue on the trolley, the player can choose to \"Push\" or \"Pull\" the trolley, causing the trolley to move one square away from or towards the player respectively. The option \"Big push\" allows the trolley to move several squares away from the player.\n\nA [[Teleportation|teleport]] is recommended for players to get to the statues' original places.\n\n===Statue of a former king, Lumbridge===\nWalk or teleport to [[Lumbridge]]; then, walk out of the [[Lumbridge Castle|castle]]. Examine both statues, and use the [[trolley]] on the one described as the statue of a \"king\" (should be the one on the south side).\n\nPush or pull the trolley across the bridge directly outside the castle. Once the trolley is on the other side of [[River Lum]], the scene will immediately change to the north backyard of [[Varrock Palace]]. Push or pull the trolley to the east, and then south into the [[Ellamaria|queen's]] garden.\n\nBe careful not to get the trolley stuck or you will have to logout and log back in to reset it.\n\nif the statue at any point gets \"recaptured\" (if you take too long to place it on the spot for the statue) , you can get another trolley from the queen and you have to go back to Lumbridge and get statue again.\n\nThe statue should be placed on the eastern side slot against the wall. When the trolley is pushed beside the spot, use the \"place\" option to place the statue, and the trolley will return to the player's inventory automatically.\n\n===Statue of Saradomin, Falador===\n{{Listen\n|title = Billy and Bob\n|align = right\n|filename = Billy and Bob.ogg\n|desc = The track that plays during the cutscene.}}\n[[File:Garden of Tranquillity pker.png|thumb|220px|A nearby player-killer creates a distraction.]]\nWalk or teleport to [[Falador]], and use the [[trolley]] on the statue; a [[cutscene]] will appear, showing two [[guard]]s, [[Bob, another guard of Falador|Bob]] and [[Billy, a guard of Falador|Billy]] at the north gate being killed by a player spoof named [[PKMaster0036]] while the player tries to push the statue onto the trolley.\n\nAfter the cutscene, the player should pull or push the trolley out of Falador ''as soon as possible''. If the player uses too much time, the guards will discover the statue has been stolen, and the player will have to start it all over again.\n\nOnce the trolley is out of Falador, the scene will immediately change to the north backyard of [[Varrock Palace]]. Again, push or pull the trolley to the east, and then south, into [[Ellamaria]]'s garden.\n\nThe statue should be placed on the central slot. When the trolley is next to the spot, use the \"place\" option to place the statue, and the trolley will return to the player's inventory automatically.\n\n==Gardening==\n'''''Items required:''' [[Ring of charos(a)]], [[#Farming equipment|farming equipment]], two buckets of [[compost]] and all seeds and saplings from earlier sections. '''Note:''' There is no [[tool leprechaun]] in the Garden.''\n[[File:Garden of Tranquillity Garden.png|left|thumb|265x265px|A map showing where each seed should be planted.]]\nYou will not need to add [[compost]] to the allotments in the garden, nor water any of the patches. Use the [[rake]] to wipe out the [[weeds]] in all farming patches, and plant the seeds/sapling to where they should be placed. However, you will need to add compost to the orchid pots before planting them. The plants in Ellamaria's Garden take 10-15 minutes to grow and cannot die. Make sure you've watered your White Tree Shoot or it won't work when you try to plant it.\nAfter all patches are fully grown and the statues are in place, talk to [[Ellamaria]], and she will ask the player to get [[King Roald]]. Go to King Roald, located in the south-east side of the [[Varrock Palace|Palace]] on the ground floor.\n[[File:Garden of Tranquillity ending.png|right|thumb|220px|King Roald is not pleased with the garden, resulting in \"Ellie\" scolding him.]]\n{{Listen\n|title = Touring the Garden\n|align = right\n|filename = Touring the Garden.ogg\n|desc = The track that plays during the cutscene.}}\nTalk to him while wearing the ring of Charos (a), and charm him when possible (or continue on without charming for an amusing conversation). A [[cutscene]] will play with the Queen giving him a tour.

Upon trying, any answer to the seventh question will work so long as the previous six were answered correctly.\n*Despite the fact that [[Queen Ellamaria]] refers to the patches as \"they have been filled with extremely fertile soil that was very expensive to import\", you still use regular compost on the plant pots to plant the orchids, although supercompost is also adequate.\n*When Queen Ellamaria slaps [[King Roald]] at the end of the last cutscene, a health bar shows up above the King's head.\n*When speaking to Kragen, the main character charms him by asking, \"What ails you, my friend?\" This may be a reference to Pepin the Healer from ''Diablo 1''. Then, the main character asks, \"So, what can I do for you?\" This may be a reference to Griswold the blacksmith from the same game series.\n\n{{Garden of Tranquillity}}\n[[Category:Garden of Tranquillity| ]]"], "Gertrude's Cat": ["{{External|rs|rsc}}\n{{Has quick guide}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Gertrude's Cat\n|number = 49\n|image = [[File:Gertrude's Cat.png|300px]]\n|members = Yes\n|release = 28 July [[2003]]\n|update = New Members Quest Online\n|series = None\n|difficulty = Novice\n|developer = Tom W\n}}\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Go to [[Gertrude]]'s house which is just west of [[Varrock]].\n|difficulty = Novice\n|description = Gertrude has lost her cat Fluffs and desperately wants to find her.

The closest bank outside of the town is located in [[Canifis]].\n:If you have access to [[fairy rings]] you may instead use the fairy ring to the west and enter the code {{Fairycode|cks}} to reach Port Phasmatys or Canifis.\n\n===Pre-quest: obtaining ecto-tokens===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Ghostspeak amulet]], 7 [[empty buckets]] (can be purchased during quest), 7 [[empty pots]] (can be purchased during quest), and 7 [[bones]] (can be obtained during quest)''\n\nTo start the quest, you will need to speak to [[Velorina]] located in the north-east corner of [[Port Phasmatys]]. However, to enter port Phasmatys you will need to exchange 2 [[ecto-token]]s every time you enter the town walls.\n*Ecto-tokens can be obtained by worshipping the [[Ectofuntus]] just north of the north entrance. Each bone used will give 5 ecto-tokens; it is recommended to make '''35 ecto-tokens''' to finish the quest - a total of 7 bones, 7 empty pots, and 7 empty buckets (or '''20 ecto-tokens''' when using the [[ring of charos(a)]] - a total of 4 bones, 4 empty pots, and 4 empty buckets). Multiple trips can be made with 1 empty bucket and 1 empty pot at a time. NOTE: [[Ghostspeak amulet]] must be equipped to claim ecto-tokens.\n*[[Charter ship|Chartering a ship]] to Port Phasmatys allows entry to the town without paying ecto-tokens as well as chartering back to [[Catherby]] allows fast access to a bank, costing 1,300gp per trip. Additionally, those who have access to the [[Arceuus spellbook]] are able to teleport directly outside [[Fenkenstrain's Castle]].\n*You can purchase buckets of slime from trade crew members on the docks of Port Phasmatys.\n*You can learn how to use the [[Ectofuntus]] by visiting the Ectofuntus page.\n\n===Beginning the quest===\n[[File:Ghost ahoy 1.png|thumb|220px|The start of the quest.]]\n'''''Items required:''' [[Ghostspeak amulet]] and 4 [[Ecto-tokens]]''\n\nPay 2 ecto-tokens (right click the Energy Barrier entrance located North of Port Phasmatys) and go to the house directly east to speak to [[Velorina]]. She will explain the sad history of the ghosts of Port Phasmatys. She will ask you to speak to [[Necrovarus]] located at the [[Ectofuntus]] temple to allow any ghost who wishes to pass over into the next world.\n[[File:Velorina the Ghost.png|thumb|220px|Velorina the ghost]]\nHead west of Velorina's house and pass the Energy Barrier again to be outside of the town's walls. Speak to Necrovarus located in the Ectofuntus temple. Necrovarus becomes furious over you mentioning Velorina and demands you be silent, refusing to listen to any reasoning.\n\nPass the Energy Barrier back into the city and speak to Velorina again. She mentions another approach: speaking to an old friend who may be used as aid without Necrovarus's involvement. When asked where she may be located, Velorina explains a vision of a small wooden shack in Morytania, where a sea is very close and castles loom to the west and east.\n\n===The old crone and nettle tea===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Nettle tea]] (or the ingredients to make: [[tinderbox]], [[logs]], [[gloves]], a [[bowl of water]]) and a [[bucket of milk]].''\n\nGo out of Port Phasmatys from the Energy Barrier and head west towards Canifis. If you need to make the nettle tea, follow the directions below while heading to Canifis:\n* Fill the empty bowl with water by using the bowl on the waterpump located west of the farm allotment patches . (Empty bowls can be purchased from the charter ships on the Phasmatys docks, buy 3 to be safe)\n* Continue west towards Canifis until you reach the slayer master [[Mazchna]]. Just east will be a patch of [[nettles]]. Wear your gloves and pick some; it is recommended to pick some spare nettles, since the Nettle-water can boil over when making tea. Note: gloves that '''cannot be used to pick up nettles''' include Slayer gloves,\u00a0Mystic gloves,\u00a0Ranger gloves,\u00a0Infinity gloves,\u00a0Moonclan gloves,\u00a0Granite gloves, and\u00a0Lunar gloves.\n* Use the nettles on the bowl of water.\n* Light a fire using your tinderbox and logs and use the bowl on fire. '''Avoid accidentally drinking the bowl'''. The bowl can also be boiled on a range, however there are no ranges in Canifis.\n* '''Note:''' Water in the bowl can boil over, causing the bowl to be lost. Be sure to have extra bowls and nettles on you or in your bank if this happens.\n[[File:Ghosts Ahoy locations.png|thumb|220px|Locations for Ghosts Ahoy.]]\nHead north-west of the slayer master [[Mazchna]] to the Old crone's house (shown on the map as a house directly east of the [[Slayer Tower]]).\n\nSpeak to the Old crone. When asked if she was a disciple of Necrovarus in the Temple of Phasmatys, she will have a hard time remembering due to her old age. She will mention that nettle tea will help refresh her memory as well as where you can find nettles.\n\nIf you have the nettle tea already made, she will exclaim that she only drinks from her special cup. She will give you a porcelain cup to pour the nettle tea into. '''Avoid accidentally drinking the bowl'''.\n\nSpeak to the Old crone again where she will refuse the tea again due to no milk being added. Add the bucket of milk to the cup of tea. '''Avoid accidentally drinking the cup of tea'''.\n\nSpeak to the Old crone again, this time she will remember being a disciple of Necrovarus. When Velorina's name is mentioned, she will remember her as a very good friend and ask how she is doing. After being told she's now a ghost, she regrets running away rather than stopping what was happening. She knows a way to help those wanting to pass over into the next world using the [[Ghostspeak amulet]]. She explains that enchanting the amulet will give power of command over ghosts; one charge will allow you to command Necrovarus to let the ghosts pass on. She explains that Necrovarus must have a magical robe that can be used to perform the enchantment. She will also need his book of rituals called [[Haricanto]] written by an ancient sorcerer from the East and [[Translation book|a\u00a0book to translate]] these rituals.\n\nAsk her if there is anything else you can do for her. She will speak about her son, and at the age of 12 years old, he ran away with some pirates to be a cabin boy. She asks if you see him, give him the toy model boat that he made. She will give you the [[model ship]].\n\n===Enchanting the amulet===\n====The Book of Haricanto====\n'''''Items required:''' [[Ghostspeak amulet]], [[Model ship]], [[silk]], a [[needle]], [[thread]], a [[knife]], [[dyes]] (3 red, 3 blue, and/or 3 yellow, the colour used will be random for each person), a [[spade]], 27 [[ecto-tokens]], and Food/Combat gear to defeat a [[Giant lobster (Ghosts Ahoy)|Giant lobster]] (level 32)''\n[[File:Poor man.png|thumb|220px|Poor man!]]Head to the [[Canifis]] bank and retrieve the items required. You can buy the needle, thread, and knife from the nearby [[Canifis General Store]]. Make sure to still have your Ghostspeak amulet and ecto-tokens.\n\nRepair the model ship by using silk, needle, thread, and knife.\n\nGo east towards Port Phasmatys. Before you pass the undead cows and undead chickens, go to the wrecked ship on the north coast (refer to map; the boat will appear as water on the mini map).\n\nClimb up the ship's ladder to the ship deck. Head east and climb the ship's ladder just outside the small room with the Old man and the Pirate Captain to get to the ship quarterdeck.\n\nThe wind speeds will appear on the top right hand side; wait for the wind speed to change to low. Search the mast in the center of the deck to find what colour the flag is comprised of. Different parts of the flag and the skull emblem are different colours. Make sure you dye the right parts of your toy ship with the right colours. You will need to check the mast a minimum of 3 times to get all 3 colours needed. Now mix what dyes you need and dye the model ship to match the mast colours.\n*Red + Yellow = Orange\n*Red + Blue = Purple\n*Blue + Yellow = Green\n[[File:Ghost ahoy 3.png|thumb|220px|The old man (boy) after you gave him the toy boat.]]\nHead back down the ship's ladder to the ship deck and talk to the [[Old man]]. Ask him if the model ship is his and he'll recognise it. For giving his model ship back, he'll give you a [[Chest key (Ghosts Ahoy)|chest key]].\n\nUse the key on the closed chest inside the captain's quarters to receive the first [[map scrap]].\n\nGo to the north-west side of deck where there is a gangplank you can walk onto rocks. Jump along the path of rocks. Each jump costs 5% of your run energy. It is possible to fail the jumps. When you get to the end, there will be another chest with the second map scrap. Once you have the second map scrap, head back to the ship.\n[[File:Ghost ahoy 4.png|thumb|220px|The lobster fight.]]\nClimb down the ship's ladder. When you open the next chest you will be attacked - '''be ready to fight'''. Search the chests until you are attacked by a [[Giant lobster (Ghosts Ahoy)|giant lobster]] ''(level 32)'' with a blinking yellow arrow over it. Once you kill it, search the chest again for the final map scrap.\n\nYou can [[safespot]] the lobster by standing west of the ladder (the one nearest to the chests) and using [[Magic]] or [[Ranged]]. However, if you do not kill the lobster fast enough, it will disappear and you will have to fight it again from full health.\n[[File:Ghost ahoy 5.png|thumb|220px|The boat to the island.]]\nAfter you've received all pieces, use one piece on another to get a completed [[treasure map]]. It marks where to find treasure on [[Dragontooth Island]]. Head east to [[Port Phasmatys]]. Pass the Energy Barrier to enter the town and go to the bank. If you haven't already, grab 25 ecto-tokens (or 10, if you have an [[activated ring of charos]]), a [[spade]], and the treasure map.\n[[File:Ga treasure.png|thumb|220px|The approximate location of the book.]]\nHead north-east from the bank onto the dock and find the Ghost captain next to the small rowing boat. Ask him to take you to Dragontooth Island, and he will oblige for a 25 ecto-token fee. Once there, use the map to find the treasure. You can proceed to the square pictured to the right. You will be standing in the only grass-less square in the clearing. If you follow the instructions from the map you will start by standing west of the Statue of Saradomin. From there, walk 6 steps '''south''', 8 steps '''east''', 2 steps '''north''', 4 steps '''east''', and 22 steps '''south'''. Dig with a spade and you will find the [[Book of haricanto|Book of Haricanto]].\n\n====The translation manual====\n'''''Items required:''' Around 400 [[coins]] and an [[oak longbow]].''\n\nAfter finding the Book of Haricanto, head north to the ghost captain and travel back to Port Phasmatys. Go to the bank just south-west of the boat, and take about 400\u00a0[[coins]]\u00a0and the\u00a0[[oak longbow]].\n\nHead north of the bank. Go onto the docks just east of the pub/inn and talk to\u00a0[[Ak-Haranu]]. He is a trader from the east. After being asked if he has a book that can be used to translate. He'll tell you he has the [[Translation manual|manual]], but in trade for it, he wants Robin's signature on an oak longbow.\n\nGo to the pub/inn just west of Ak-Haranu and talk to [[Robin]]. He'll challenge you to a game of Runedraw. Beat him at it a few times until he owes you 100 coins (the objective of the game is to get as many points as possible, awarded when you draw a rune, before drawing a [[death rune]], which results in an automatic loss; if Robin draws a death rune before you, you win). He will give you his signature to repay the debt.\n\nTake it back to Ak-Haranu and he'll give you the manual as promised.\n\n====The robes====\n'''''Items required: '''[[Ghostspeak amulet]] and [[bucket of slime]] (can be purchased during quest)''\n\nHead back to the pub/inn and speak to the innkeeper. Ask him if he has any jobs for you and he will give you a [[bedsheet]] that he wants you to take to [[Robin]]. Rather than doing that, keep the bedsheet; you will be using it to disguise yourself as a ghost.\n\nGhosts do not look like bedsheets, so to make it passable you need to colour it with [[Ectofuntus]] slime. A fast way to get some slime is by trading with one of the [[trader crewmember|trader crew member]]s on the east docks\u00a0and buying a [[bucket of slime]]\u00a0to dip the bedsheet in.\u00a0Alternatively, use the Ectofuntus by walking down to the slime pool with an empty bucket, and fill it with slime. After you get the bucket of slime, dip the sheet into it.\n\nGo to the town square near the north entrance of Port Phasmatys and talk to [[Gravingas]], the ghost activist protesting and carrying a sign. He will ask if you will partake in the protest, to which you will accept happily. He'll give you a petition to collect signatures from the townsfolk. Put your dyed bedsheet on and gather 10 signatures.\n\nSpeak to any ghost villager nearby for signatures. As long as you don't talk to the same person twice in a row, you can ask the same two or three ghosts for all 10 signatures. If they ask for ecto-tokens, move onto the next ghost that doesn't require payment. Alternatively, you could ask the same people by switching worlds. Repeat until they say \"yes\" enough times to have 10 signatures.\n\nWith all 10 signatures, talk to Gravingas. He will ask you to go back to [[Necrovarus]] and show him the petition.\n\nHead north of Gravingas and pass the Energy Barrier. Speak to Necrovarus and show him the petition form. He will ask you continue explaining the petition which outlines that the citizens of Port Phasmatys should have the right to choose whether they pass over to the next world or not. He will sarcastically say that he understands, then flies into a rage, causing him to drop a bone key. Pick it up and head upstairs. Use the key on the locked door to get into his room. Open and search the coffin to find [[Mystical robes|his robes]]. Leave the room and head back downstairs.\n\n===Using the spell===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Mystical robes]], [[Book of haricanto|Book of Haricanto]], [[translation manual]], and a [[Ghostspeak amulet]].''\n\nFrom the Ectofuntus, head back to the Old Crone, just north of Canifis.\n\nGive her the [[Mystical robes|robes]], [[Book of haricanto|book]], [[Translation manual|manual]], and Ghostspeak amulet in your possession. The Old crone will perform an enchantment ritual - dancing - on your amulet, empowering it.\n\nHead back east to the [[Ectofuntus]] and speak with [[Necrovarus]]; make sure your ghostspeak amulet is equipped. Command Necrovarus to release all the ghosts he's holding. You can command him to tell you the joke first or do the chicken impersonation; both of which won't deplete the ghost amulet's charge. A beam of green light will radiate out from the amulet, enveloping Necrovarus in its power. He will appear to become much softer in the eyes and stare into nothingness. He will then allow the ghosts to pass at their will.\n\nOnce finished speaking to Necrovarus, pass through the Energy Barrier (this will not consume any ecto-tokens from now on) and speak to [[Velorina]]. She will tell you that she sensed the removal of Necrovarus's psychic barrier. She will then hand you a vial of ectoplasm as her thanks in return, and explain the use of this newly acquired item: an [[Ectophial]].\n\n'''Congratulations!

It's still much further than the [[slayer ring]] and [[quest cape]] teleports, however.\n*You can get multiple ectophials by asking [[Velorina]] for another.\n\n==Trivia==\n*If you speak to the old man after he gives you the chest key, he will tell you his mother is on her way to get him.\n*You can give Robin the bedsheets if you wish to do so. The innkeeper will give you another bedsheet to give Robin again.\n*A drop trick method can be done to obtain multiple bedsheets, in case you want a brown bedsheet as well as the ghost green bedsheet.\n*If you talk to Gravingas after the quest, your character will ask him why he's still protesting, to which he replies, \"There's always a need for a healthy interest in politics.\"\n\n==Required for completing==\n*[[Dragon Slayer II]]\n*[[Morytania Medium Diary]]\n\n{{Ghosts Ahoy}}"], "Goblin Diplomacy": ["{{Has quick guide}}\n{{External|rs|rsc}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Goblin Diplomacy\n|image = [[File:Goblin Diplomacy.png|300px]]\n|release = 8 May [[2001]]\n|update = Runescape updated (8 May 2001)\n|members = No\n|series = None\n|difficulty = Novice\n|number = 15\n|developer = Paul Gower\n}}\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|description=There's a disturbance in the Goblin Village.

They will say that the [[goblin]] race is on the brink of civil war over armour colour, and they want their armour to be orange.\n\n===Gathering the required items===\n''Skip this subsection if you already have the items required.''\n\nAsk the generals where you can get orange armour. Eventually, one will answer that you can dye [[Goblin mail]] orange. [[Grubfoot]] will mention he stole yellow dye from a witch in [[Draynor Village]], and mentions you may be able to find it there. One of the generals will mention you can find goblin mail in three different crates around the village.\nGrab the suits of goblin mail from the following crates:\n*Behind the generals' hut.\n*Inside the western hut in between the small square hut and the generals' hut.\n*Up a ladder near the entrance.\n''Note: Don't dye 3 pieces of armour. You only want 1 blue and 1 orange. Leave one plain. If you mistakingly paint an armour you won't get new ones from the crates.''\n\nAlternatively, goblin mail can be obtained as a drop from killing [[goblin]]s. The goblins in [[Goblin Village]] drop red or green goblin mails, which can be dyed, but you will need one uncolored one from a standard goblin.\n\n[[Wyson]] the head gardener in [[Falador Park]] will sell you the needed [[woad leaves]]. Ask him if you can buy some. When you do, he'll ask how much you are willing to pay. Say, \"About 20 coins,\" and he'll say you are generous and will give you two woad leaves. This is easier and cheaper than the alternative, which is to say, \"About 15 coins,\" and he will give you only one woad leaf. Do this again, and the total price will ring up at 30 [[coins]].\n\nTwo [[onions]] can easily be picked from the field just north of [[Rimmington]], or alternate places such as [[Lumbridge]], in the backyard of [[Farmer Fred]]'s farm, which is next to the sheep paddock.\n\nThree [[redberries]] can be purchased from [[Wydin's Food Store]] in [[Port Sarim]] for 3 coins each or picked west of [[Varrock|Varrock's]] [[South-east Varrock mine|south-east mine]].\n\n===Making the dyes===\n''Skip this subsection if you already have [[Orange dye]] and [[Blue dye]].''\n\nYou need to make orange dye and blue dye. Orange dye is made from combining [[red dye]] (3 [[redberries]] and 5 coins from [[Aggie]] in Draynor Village) with [[yellow dye]] (2 [[onions]] and 5 coins). If you do not already have the yellow dye and red dye, take the supplies to [[Aggie]] the witch in [[Draynor Village]], and then mix the yellow dye and red dye together to create the orange dye.\n\nLikewise, if you don't already have the blue dye, take 2 [[woad leaves]] and 5 coins to Aggie to create the blue dye.\n\n===The generals' verdict===\n[[File:Goblin Diplomacy - Grubfoot cutscene.png|thumb|Grubfoot trying the orange goblin mail.]]\nDye one [[Goblin mail]] orange, one blue, and leave the last one unaltered.\n\nGo back to [[Goblin Village]], and give the orange goblin mail to the generals. They will have [[Grubfoot]] try it on, and say they do not like it. They will ask for blue armour. Give them the blue goblin mail. Again, they will have Grubfoot try it on, and again, it is rejected. They now want brown. Give them the plain brown goblin mail. Grubfoot tries it on for the last time.

The desert phoenix is also nearby.]]\n\nThe first thing you should do is repair the broken clay golem. If you did not bring your own [[clay]], go north-west and mine four pieces of clay\u00a0while wearing a [[bracelet of clay]]\u00a0to mine\u00a0[[soft clay]]. While there, you can steal the [[phoenix feather]] needed for later. It may take a few tries (depending on your [[Thieving]] level). Stealing a phoenix feather gives you 26 Thieving [[experience]].\n\nAs you use the soft clay on the Broken Golem, he will become less damaged and later, repaired. He will tell you that he was programmed to destroy a powerful demon, [[Thammaron]]. You need to help him slay the demon. Make sure to ask him how to open the portal.\n\nEnter the temple ruins behind the golem. Before climbing down the stairs, pick up two [[black mushroom]]s (one for the quest and one for the quest's sequel, [[Shadow of the Storm]]) next to the staircase. Once inside, head to the north-west corner of the room and pick up the [[strange implement]]. The implement is also used during Shadow of the Storm, so it is advised to keep it as well.\n\n[[File:Elissa location.png|thumb|left|The location of Elissa.]]\n\nOutside the temple ruins near the golem, take a [[Letter (The Golem)|letter]] from near the crates and read it. Then, go to the [[Digsite]] south-east of [[Varrock]]. (''Optional:'' You can use [[gnome glider]] to get to the Digsite and then use ring of dueling to return back.) Find [[Elissa]] in the north-eastern part of the Digsite, and tell her you found a letter with her name on it\u2014she is wearing green/brown robes. She will tell you about her late husband's notes and where they are located.

Ask the [[Curator]] about a missing statuette. Then, [[pickpocket]] him to get a [[display cabinet key]]. Unlock the display case upstairs to steal the [[statuette (The Golem)|statuette]].

If you have not already done so, while walking back to the ruins, after you cross the bridge, go north along the east bank of the river to up near the clay mine and grab a phoenix feather from the [[Desert Phoenix]].\n\n[[File:The Golem - the alcove.png|thumb|200px|The alcove in the centre where the statuette goes.]]\n[[File:The Golem - Thammaron's remains.png|thumb|200px|The dead demon.]]\nAt Uzer, enter the dungeon near the golem and go to the middle. Use the statuette on the empty alcove. Turn all of them to face the double doors to unlock the demon's lair. Go inside to discover that [[Thammaron]] had perished from his wounds from the battle long ago. Should you wish to do so, use your chisel and hammer on the throne to get six gems which you can keep, and then go outside and talk to the clay golem again. He was not programmed to believe that the demon is dead, so you'll need to reprogram him.\n\nWith an empty vial in your inventory, use your pestle and mortar on the\u00a0black mushroom\u00a0to make [[black mushroom ink]].

He can be found south of the [[POH|Player Owned House]]\u00a0portal. Talk to him, and he will ask you to get two rare items in return for his [[magic beans]]:\n*The first item is a [[Griffin feather|feather]] from the griffin, [[Grimgnash]],\u00a0on [[White Wolf Mountain]]\u2014go north on the east trail.\n*The second is a [[Rupert's helmet|helmet]] from a dwarf named [[Rupert]]\u2014in a tower south-west of the\u00a0[[Mind altar]].\n\n==Griffin's feather==\n[[File:Path_to_the_Griffin.png|right|thumb|250px|The path to take to see Grimgnash, the griffin.]]\n[[File:Telling stories.png|right|thumb|250px|Telling a story to Grimgnash, the griffin.]]\nTo reach [[Grimgnash]], proceed to [[White Wolf Mountain]] from [[Taverley]], and follow the path that is located the farthest east along the mountain until you reach two white lines. Go through them, and up the path to reach the NPC.\n\nThe Griffin will state that it cannot get to sleep because of the howling wolves and will threaten to eat the player if he doesn't tell him a bedtime story. Grimgnash says he loves stories with death, fire and destruction. Tell him a bedtime story by selecting the options, which sound the most violent:\n*''I heard you were a great and mighty Griffin!'' '''(Option 1)'''\n*''There once was a graveyard filled with undead.'' '''(Option 1)'''\n*''There lived a skeleton named Skullrot.'' '''(Option 2)'''\n*''Skullrot was insane!'' '''(Option 4)'''\n*''Skullrot hungrily grabbed the gnome's hair.'' '''(Option 4)''' (Skullrot grabbed an axe is also acceptable)\n*''Started to strangle the poor gnome.'' '''(Option 3)'''\n*''At this point, you can answer with any of the remaining choices.''\n\nOnce Grimgnash is asleep, steal a [[Griffin feather|feather]] from the pile next to his nest and go back to [[Sylas]].\n\n'''Note:''' If you have a low [[Hitpoints]] level, be careful. If Grimgnash doesn't like your story, he will hit you with 10-20 points of damage.\n\n==Rupert's helmet==\n===Meeting Rupert===\n[[Rupert the Beard]] can be found in a tower in between [[Goblin Village]] and [[Ice Mountain]]. The quickest way to get there is by casting [[Mind Altar Teleport]] (or using its [[Mind altar teleport|magic tablet equivalent]]) and running southward.\n\nIf you attempt to get in by the door of the tower, a rather snobby-looking [[Miazrqa|princess]] will stop you. In order to get in, you will need to go around the back and climb over the crumbling wall (58 Thieving required).\n[[File:Rupert the Beard in tower.png|thumb|left|120px|Rupert locked away.]]\nNext, talk into the drain pipe, and you will find yourself talking to the dwarf imprisoned at the top of the tower.\n\nTalk to him a second time to find out how to get up the tower, and suggest that you should climb up, and then ask if there is anything up there that can help. He will throw down his beard\u2014climb it (59 [[Agility]] required). Talk to the dwarf who regrettably cannot give you his [[Rupert's helmet|helmet]] as the princess has stolen his armour and locked him in the tower.\n\nHe asks you to talk to Princess [[Miazrqa]], who is north of the tower. She says that she will happily release the dwarf if you get back her [[Miazrqa's pendant|pendant]], which was stolen by a mouse in her [[Nora T. Hagg|second-cousin's (twice-removed)]] house which is the [[witch's house]] in [[Taverley]].\n\nAsk the princess for a [[Key (Witch's House)|door key]] in order to enter the witch's house, or look under the potted plant just to the left of the front door of the witch's house.\n\n===Miazrqa's pendant===\n'''''Items required: '''leather gloves (optional), 2 tarromin potions (unf)''' or '''2 tarromins and 2 vials of water''\n\n'''This step is optional. To continue, skip to the next paragraph.''' Go to the basement of [[Witch's House]], and wear some [[leather gloves]] to avoid an electric shock from the gate, which can cause 16 damage. (Gloves can be obtained by repeatedly searching the boxes in the basement near the piano. You may also get other junk like [[needle]]s and [[cabbage]]s\u2014keep trying until you get the gloves.) Open the cage door, and search the music stand to find some [[music sheet]]s for the piano. Read the music sheet\u2014now, you have to play that on the piano.\n[[File:Music sheet read.png|right|thumb|130px|Music Sheet]]\n\nThis is where it gets tricky if you are not familiar with the piano. You have to play the notes: \"''EFEDCAEGA''\". The first five notes (\"''EFEDC''\") are on the right side of the piano; the next last notes (\"''AEGA''\") are on the left side of the piano. Although the notes are displayed when you hover over them on the left side of the screen, you must remember whether they are lower or upper notes.\n* '''Note:''' Counting the keys from right to left, click them in this order: key 5, key 4, key 5, key 6, then 7, 9, 12, 10, 9.\n\nThe compartment will open, and the player will find three items in it: a [[shrinking recipe]], [[to-do list]], and two [[shrunk ogleroot]]s. Read the shrinking recipe, and use your [[tarromin]] with 2 [[vial of water|vials of water]], and add the ogleroot to both unfinished potions. Go upstairs, and drink one of the [[Shrink-me-quick|potions]] while standing next to the mouse hole in the southern room on the ground floor (no [[cheese]] or [[Magnet (Witch's House)|magnet]] required). The player will suddenly shrink and will enter in the mouse hole.\n\n*'''Note:''' You must keep the second Shrinking potion in order to complete the quest.\n*If you lose the Shrunk Ogleroot, you will have to kill the [[Experiment No.2|experiments]] in the basement of the witch's house to get them. Players can enter it from outside the house using the manhole. Tarromin can also be obtained from the experiments.\n*If you have 48 Herblore, you can boost it to 52 by eating a [[Botanical pie]].\n[[File:Obtaining Miazrqa's pendant.png|thumb|Finding the pendant.]]\n\n===Mouse's hole===\n[[Protect from Melee]] is helpful in this part because of continuous attacks by level 95 creatures. \n\n'''<span style=\"color:red\">Warning:</span>''' Do '''NOT''' go into the northeastern grate, or you will end up in sprouting back up and have to make another potion to go back into the initial hole again.\n\n[[File:Freedom.png|thumb|left|Rupert is free!]]\nYou will need to go through several nail walls to get to the [[Miazrqa's pendant|pendant]]. These nail walls are four nails stuck closely together on the wall. They are indicated as '''wooden ladders on the mini-map.''' Climb the nail walls to the north on the eastern wall located south of the grate, and then, continue south-west and climb up two sets of nails. Go north-east, and climb down the nails. Head north and climb up the last set of nails, and take the pendant. Return to the tower, and give the pendant to the [[Miazrqa|Princess]]. [[Rupert]] will be set free, and he will give you his [[Rupert's helmet|helmet]]. Head back to [[Sylas]].\n\n==Sylas and the beanstalk==\n'''''Items required: '''a seed dibber, a watering can (with atleast 1 dose), and equipment to fight [[Glod]]. Also, bank your follower if you have one out, you won't be able to have it in your inventory either.''\n\nTake the [[Magic beans|beans]] [[Sylas]] gives you, and plant them in the special patch south-east of [[Taverley]], near the [[tree patch]]. The signpost reads \"This earth mound has been magically prepared. Please keep off. Farming strictly prohibited. You have been warned!\" A [[seed dibber]] and [[watering can]] are required, which can be obtained from the\u00a0[[Tool leprechaun]] at the nearby tree patch to the north-east, or purchased at a [[farming store]].\nAfter watering the patch, a giant beanstalk will grow extremely fast.\n[[File:Planting magic beans.gif|frame|centre|Planting the magic beans.]]\n\n==The battle==\nGet ready for a fight with a level 138.\n\n'''<span style=\"color:red\">WARNING:</span> The fight is instanced, so if you die, you will not be able to retrieve your belongings. Therefore, only bring items you are willing to lose.'''\n\nTake high healing [[food]] and some [[prayer potion]]s. Make sure to keep your second oogleroot/shrink-me-quick potion either in your bank or inventory for after the fight. When you're ready, climb up the beanstalk (requires 59 [[Agility]]). You will not be able to have a follower with you, even in your inventory.\n[[File:Fighting Glod.png|thumb|left|Fighting the angry Glod.]]\n[[Glod]], a cloud giant, will attack you immediately. He is level 118, but will become level 138 shortly after the battle starts. He is difficult to damage with low [[Melee]] as he hits very hard, so [[Ranged]] is a much better option if you have low Melee stats, as Ranged is his weakness. [[Magic]] works well too. The [[Iban's staff (u)|upgraded Iban's Staff's]] [[Iban Blast]] is very effective, but do prepare plenty of [[runes]] and range [[ammunition]]. Glod is immune to [[poison]].\n\nPlayers with high Melee, Ranged, or Magic levels shouldn't have much difficulty beating him. However, those with low Melee should use Ranged or Magic. Choose whichever combat skill you feel comfortable and/or have the highest experience in to defeat him. \n\nPlayers with 70+ combat stats should have absolutely no problem defeating him as the battle could be done with minimal damage sustained. However it is advised that you prepare as stated above.\n\nUse [[Protect from Melee]] whenever you can. Cast your best [[spell]] or range at a distance while hiding behind a wall. He will sometimes taunt you, causing your character to attack him head on. Whenever this happens, run back to the wall, and turn on Protect from Melee whenever you're within his hitting range. Remember to keep your health high as Glod's Melee attack is very accurate and can hit as high as 24. \n\nHe will also sometimes quake the ground, draining your [[Prayer]] and will also sometimes heal himself. When your prayer is drained, drink a dose of your prayer potion, quickly activate Protect from Melee, and heal up while continuing your attacks. You should keep attacking whenever you can in order to defeat him as quickly as possible. \n\n===After the battle===\n'''''Items required: '''the other shrinking potion, any''' '''axe, boost for Woodcutting if below level 71''\n\nOnce you defeat [[Glod]], he'll drop the [[golden goblin]]. Take it back to [[Sylas]]. He will ask you to chop the beanstalk down (71 [[Woodcutting]] required). Use a [[shrinking potion]] on the beanstalk first; then, take an [[axe]] and chop away. Go back to Sylas for your reward.\n[[File:Felling beanstalk.gif|frame|centre|Chopping the beanstalk down.]]\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Grim Tales\n|image = [[File:Grim Tales reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = *{{skill clickpic|Farming|4,000}} [[Farming]] experience\n*{{skill clickpic|Herblore|5,000}} [[Herblore]] experience\n*{{skill clickpic|Hitpoints|5,000}} [[Hitpoints]] experience\n*{{skill clickpic|Woodcutting|14,000}} [[Woodcutting]] experience\n*{{skill clickpic|Agility|6,000}} [[Agility]] experience\n*{{skill clickpic|Thieving|6,000}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*[[Dwarven helmet]] (equip this helmet in the [[Dwarven Mines]] to complete a [[Hard Falador Diary|hard Falador task]])\n}}\n==Music==\n*[[Fe Fi Fo Fum]]\n*[[Mouse Trap]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*This quest parodies and references several fairy tales:\n**Many parts of the quest, including the name, are references to the well-known fairy tale collection [[wikipedia:Grimm's Fairy Tales|Grimm's Fairy Tales]]. A few tales from the collection that are referenced:\n***The Griffin (getting a feather from a griffin by telling it stories)\n***Rapunzel (climbing Rupert's beard)\n***Jack and the Beanstalk (climbing a magic beanstalk for a golden reward).\n**The [[Shrinking potion]] is a reference to [[Wikipedia:Alice in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]].\n*On the first day of release when you clicked to see the rewards you got the message \"Spoilers are only given on the day of release in fairy tales.\"\n*After the player names the gnome in the story with Grimgnash, Grimgnash gets upset. He claims \"You shouldn't name food! If Human had a carrot, would Human call it Jasper?\" This is a reference to the British Comedian ''Jasper Carrot''.\n*The silent 'q' in the princess' name is a reference to the book shop sketch by Monty Python.\n*When trying to pronounce the princess' name, your character says \"...Marzipan?\" - a reference to either a character in the online comic {{wp|Homestar Runner}} or the [[Wikipedia:Marzipan|sugar and almond confection]] that she's named after.\n*[[Glod]], the quest's final boss, resembles [[wikipedia:Hulk (comics)|The Hulk]] in many ways. Both are bare-chested, have discoloured skin, and have a similar face and hairstyle. Glod even yells \"GLOD SMASH!\", just like the Hulk.\n*Glod may possibly be named after characters in Norse mythology, Glut, who was a particularly evil giant, and Hod, the god who guarded the Bifrost Bridge, who is similar in build to Glod.\n*If you take the 'd' off the end of [[Rupert the Beard]], you're left with Rupert The Bear, a once popular fictional character.\n*This quest has the third highest skill level requirement of any other quest, with [[Woodcutting]] at level 71, beaten by [[Dragon Slayer II]], with a requirement of 75 [[Magic]] and [[Making Friends with My Arm]], with a requirement of 72 Mining. \n*When a player is in the mouse hole, if he/she kills a mouse, the mouse's drops ([[bones]], [[coins]], and [[cheese]]) will be larger than normal. If the player pick them up, they will appear as \"normal\" in the player's inventory.\n*When the player asks about Sylas' rare items, he mentions his most prized possession a 'horn-less Unicorn'. This references the running joke that horses do not exist in RuneScape and the popular requests for mountable horses from the pre-Old School community. Diango in Draynor Village also references this with his effectively useless horse trinkets, which were initially announced merely as \"horses.\" \n\n{{Grim Tales}}\n[[Category:Master quests]]\n[[Category:Taverley]]"], "Haunted Mine": ["{{External|rs}}{{Has quick guide}}{{otheruses|the [[quest]]|the haunted mine in which it is set|Abandoned Mine}}\n{{redirect3|Haunted|For the forest, see [[Haunted Woods]]}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Haunted Mine\n|image = [[File:Haunted Mine.png|300px]]\n|number = 66\n|members = Yes\n|release = 21 December [[2004]]\n|update = The Haunted Mine\n|series = None\n|difficulty = Experienced\n|developer = Ian G\n}}\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Speak to the [[Zealot]] at the mines in [[Morytania]] on the path to Mort'ton.\n|difficulty = 3\n|description = Recent forays into Morytania by some of Saradomin's more fanatical supporters have unearthed murky rumours concerning an abandoned mine in the south.

It is important to be well-prepared for the fight!'''\n\nBring all the items required to finish the quest, including supplies for the boss fight (don't forget to bring a [[druid pouch]] if travelling through the swamps). To begin the quest, players need to head to the [[Abandoned Mine]], which can be found in the south-west part of the [[Mort Myre Swamp|Morytania Swamps]]. From [[Canifis]], head west and enter the swamps through the gate. Travel south along the [[River Salve]]. Begin along the long winding path to [[Mort'ton]]. At the most south-west part of the path is the starting point of this quest. Look for a grey field on the minimap.\n\nTravel times may be shortened by using the following [[fairy ring]] codes:\n*{{Fairycode|cks}} - West of [[Canifis]] at the entrance gate of the swamp\n*{{Fairycode|bkr}} - South of Canifis a short ways into the swamp\n*{{Fairycode|bip}} - On an island west of the [[Nature Grotto]], which lies in the southern part of the swamp. You'll need level 50 [[Agility]] to cross a stepping stone to get to [[Morytania]].\nProvided that you have completed the [[Shades of Mort'ton]] quest, you can also use the Shades of Mort'ton [[minigame teleport]] in the minigames' tab.\n\n===Saradominist zealot===\n[[File:Haunted Mine zealot.png|thumb|220px|The [[Zealot]].]]\nIn the area north of the Abandoned Mine, a [[Zealot]] is walking around. Tell him you are on the path of Saradomin and you seek challenges and quests. He will tell you about the secret cave and the [[salve amulet]]. He has a key, but will refuse to give it to the player. \n\n[[Pickpocket]] him to get the [[zealot's key]], which is needed later in the quest.

Pick up the [[chisel]] from the spawn on top of a crate if you did not bring one. Locate the water valve on the east side of the large pipe. Use [[Zealot's key]] on the valve to activate the water flow. A [[ghost]] will appear and will try to shut off the valve. Run quickly around the water pipe system to the elevator lift and \"Go down Lift\" to Cave Level 5. The elevator remains operational after the initial activation, so Zealot's key is no longer needed. [[Zealot]] can be pickpocketed again to obtain another key.\n[[File:Abandoned Mine Level 5.png|thumb|220px|Cave Level 5 - Staircase 14 leads down to [[Treus Dayth]]. Staircase 15 leads down to the Crystal Mine. For more details, see [[Abandoned Mine#Level 5|this]].]]\nThe elevator will drop the player into a pool of water. From the elevator, walk south onto the track and follow it to the east. Proceed down the staircase. With the [[glowing fungus]], the cave will be properly lit. Go west through the door to a big room with cranes and carts. This room is where the boss fight will take place. '''Do not take the key until you are completely ready to begin!'''\n\n===The boss fight===\n'''Important note:''''' Read this part fully before entering the fight if you're not experienced with the fight! Especially if you're low [[Combat]]!''\n\nThis boss fight is difficult and should not be taken lightly. High-healing food is recommended. The surrounding environment is more dangerous than the actual [[Treus Dayth|ghost]]. A highly viable strategy for low to mid-level players who can equip [[Iban's staff]] (requiring 50 [[Attack]], [[Magic]], and completion of [[Underground Pass]]) is to use [[Iban Blast]], as it hits accurately (especially against this boss) and very hard. If using [[Melee]], bring the highest-hitting [[melee weapon]] you can use, such as a [[2h sword]] ([[Zamorak godsword]] works well as the special will prevent him from teleporting) or [[halberd]], as this boss has a high chance to teleport somewhere else after being hit.\n\n'''Important tip''': If things get heavy and too difficult, you can walk out by the door on the east and easily re-pot there, manage [[prayer]], heal up, etc. The instance will not reset, and [[Treus]] will still be at the same amount of health as to when you left the door.\n\nDuring the fight, carts and cranes around the room\u00a0will start to operate and can cause major harm, so players should avoid them when possible. The cranes are stationary and can hit hard, but they are inaccurate and easily avoided by staying out of their reach. The carts can only move along the track they are on, similar to the other carts in the dungeon. However, these carts are dangerous because they can hit hard \u2014 rapidly up to 7 damage while dragging a player along the track. Additionally, [[pickaxe]]s will be '''constantly''' thrown at the player during the fight, hitting as much as 10 damage in one attack, so, even though it won't protect 100%, [[Protect from Missiles]] is recommended for this fight. Magic attacks are very effective against him.\n[[File:Haunted Mine key crate.png|thumb|220px|The crystal mine key appears suspiciously easy to take.]]\nTo start the fight, try to pick up the [[Crystal-mine key|innocent-looking key]]. Click continue, and the ghost [[Treus Dayth]] (combat level 95) will appear and will start to attack after a small cut scene introduction. He will be identified on the minimap as a flashing yellow arrow. When chasing Treus Dayth, try to stay out of the way of the moving carts and the cranes. The ghost itself is not that strong, but the damage from the environment can be serious. The ghost will continually teleport after some hits are dealt \u2014 and the more the fight progresses, the sooner it will teleport, sometimes even after one hit, which is where weapons with a high maximum hit comes in handy \u2014 which makes killing this boss very difficult without [[Energy potion|energy]]/[[super energy]] potions. A large supply of food and optionally potions is advised depending on your combat level. An emergency teleport, like the [[Ectophial]] is very useful too. It is not possible to freeze the ghost from moving using Magic or [[Ancient Magicks]]. [[Crumble Undead]] works well against him as does a [[Trident of the seas]] or a [[Trident of the swamp]].\n[[File:Fighting Treus Dayth.png|thumb|A player fighting [[Treus Dayth]].]]\nAn example strategy that works quite well: bring a 4-dose [[Prayer potion]], optionally a [[Ranging potion]], and the best [[Ranged weapon]]ry you can muster, along with an inventory filled with food. Use Protect from Missiles at all times. When you reach Treus Dayth, switch on [[Eagle Eye]] to make your shots count, shoot, and then switch it off when he moves away (keep Protect from Missiles on). He likes moving between the northwestern and northeastern side of the room, in which case you are recommended to run along the northernmost cart track in the detached tunnel, where you only have to dodge one cart. If he moves south, try to hug the cavern walls to avoid the cranes as you approach him. However, don't hesitate while fighting \u2014 it's better to take a bit of extra damage and be faster than be indecisive and suffer as a result. Before fighting, you are also recommended to explore the room and practice how you are going to move around without taking too much damage \u2014 the machinery doesn't activate before the fight.\n\nUsing a [[Dragon dagger]] is also a good alternative. The dragon dagger [[special attack]] hits twice in one go, but this boss will only receive one of those hits before he moves away to a new spot and before you even get to him the second attack from the dagger will automatically hit him. You can keep using this tactic on the boss with minimum movement as you can use the dragon dagger's special attack numerous times during the fight.\n\nA good mid-tier magic attack that works effectively is [[Iban Blast]], or even [[Fire Bolt]] wearing [[chaos gauntlets]] on the cheap. The only downside to magic is that [[magic armour]] provides very little Ranged Defence; however, since the boss has negative magic defence, you can have a negative magic attack bonus of -35 or higher and still hit consistently. This allows for a set such as [[rune platebody]]/[[rune platelegs|platelegs]]/[[rune kiteshield|kiteshield]], [[farseer helm]], [[amulet of glory]], [[barrows gloves|Recipe for Disaster gloves]]/chaos gauntlets, and [[boots of lightness]] with Iban's staff/[[elemental staff]] to be an effective set both for damage and defence against the boss. Combined with decent food/prayer potions, you should be able to kill this boss fairly easy by just [[praying range]] and running back and forth along the northern tunnel if possible.\n\n===Getting the crystal===\n[[File:Haunted Mine crystal mine.png|thumb|220px|The long sought-after crystal mine.]]\nAfter defeating [[Treus Dayth]], pick up the innocent-looking key, which in fact is the [[crystal-mine key]]. Now, head back east through the door and climb up the stairs. Walk west until you reach another staircase and head down. Walk down the corridor. The crystal-mine key opens the large door to a room with a [[crystal outcrop]] in the south-east corner. Use a [[chisel]] to cut a piece from the crystal outcrop. If you forgot your chisel, go back up the lift and pick a chisel on a crate. You will obtain a [[salve shard]]. Be sure to cut extras for backup! Quest Complete!\n\n==Additional tips==\n*Players can use a [[ball of wool]] on a salve shard to make a [[Salve amulet]].\n*The [[Crystal-mine key|mining key]], obtained after killing the [[Treus|ghost]], can be put on the [[steel key ring]].\n*Unless the player has a low [[Defence]] or [[Prayer]] level, it is often more efficient to rush the boss directly, [[tanking]] the crane hits than it is to spend time navigating the area.\n*Mining [[mithril ore]] within the [[Abandoned Mine]] is a hard task in the [[Morytania Diary]] set. You can receive a pickaxe by attempting to take one of the [[iron pickaxe]]s lying on the ground near the bottom of the lift, which will come to life (level-50) before dropping an iron pickaxe.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Haunted Mine\n|image = [[File:Haunted Mine reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = *{{Skill clickpic|Strength|22,000}} [[Strength]] [[experience]]\n*The ability to make the [[Salve amulet]], which when equipped gives combat bonuses against undead monsters.\n*Access to a [[Abandoned_Mine#Shortcut_after_the_quest|shortcut]] to the [[crystal outcrop]]s\n*Access to [[Tarn's Lair]]\n}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Mischievous ghost who attempts to shut the water valve and stop the lift will wail \"wooo ooo oooo\", even when wearing a [[ghostspeak amulet]].\n{{Haunted Mine}}"], "Hazeel Cult": ["{{External|rs|rsc=The Hazeel Cult}}\n{{Floor}}{{Has quick guide}}{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Hazeel Cult\n|image = [[File:Hazeel revived.png|250px]]\n|number = 33\n|members = Yes\n|release = 15 August [[2002]]\n|update = Sheep and cults\n|series = [[List of quest series#Mahjarrat quest series|Mahjarrat]]\n|difficulty = Novice\n\n|developer = Tom W\n}}\n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Central [[Ardougne]], south of [[King Lathas]]' [[Ardougne Castle|castle]].

You can either choose to help [[Ceril Carnillean]] get his family armour back and foil the plan to revive [[Hazeel]], or you can choose to help Hazeel's followers murder a Carnillean and resurrect their master. Siding with Ceril can be considered the \"good\" choice, while resurrecting Hazeel can be viewed as the \"evil\" choice.\n\n==Walkthrough for the Ceril side==\n[[File:Ceril Carnillean Location.png|thumb|220px|Start Location]]\nTo begin, head to the south-western corner of Ardougne. After speaking with [[Ceril Carnillean|Ceril]], walk south and cross the bridge. Go east of the clock tower, and find a cave. Enter it. Talk to [[Clivet]] to learn about [[Hazeel]], an ancient and powerful follower of Zamorak who was killed by an ancestor of Ceril. He will ask for your help in reviving Hazeel. '''Refuse'''. ''(It is important you ask him what he means, rather than choosing the \"you're talking rubbish\"-option. Otherwise you will not be able to get the armour from killing [[Alomone]].)''\n\nClivet will sail away on a raft, saying that you'll never be able to find him. You need to find five [[Sewer valve]]s and turn them the proper direction.\n[[File:Hazeel Cult map.png|thumb|250px|Valve locations]]\n*'''Valve 1''' - This is right across the bridge south of the Carnilleans' house. Turn it <u>'''right'''</u>.\n*'''Valve 2''' - This is right behind Carnilleans' house. Turn it <u>'''right'''</u>.\n*'''Valve 3''' - This is north of the cave. Turn it <u>'''left'''</u>.\n*'''Valve 4''' - This is south of the zoo's penguin cage. Turn it <u>'''right'''</u>.\n*'''Valve 5''' - Go southeast of the fourth valve, past the monk. Turn it <u>'''right'''</u>.\n\nAfter you've turned all five, go back into the cave, and take the raft to the cult's hideout. Talk to [[Alomone]]. He will tell you that the Carnilleans' butler should have killed you by now. He will then attack you; he's level 13. Kill him to get the [[Carnillean armour]].\u00a0\n\nKill him a second time, and use the [[drop trick]] if you would like armour of your own. Re-board the raft in order to return to the sewer entrance. Back at the Carnilleans' house, talk to [[Butler Jones]], followed by [[Ceril Carnillean]] on the {{FloorNumber|2}} of the house. He'll take the armour from you and give you 5 coins, but won't believe you about Butler Jones.\n[[File:Hazeel Cult partial completion reward scroll.png|frame|centre|The first \"reward\"]]\nSearch the cupboard on the {{FloorNumber|2}} and you will find the Mark of Hazeel and a bottle of poison. Show these to Ceril. He will fire Butler Jones and give you your reward.\n\n==Walkthrough for the [[Hazeel]] side==\nAfter talking to [[Ceril Carnillean]] and accepting to help him, walk south from Ceril's house and cross the bridge. Go east of the clock tower, and find a cave. Enter it. Talk to [[Clivet]] to learn about [[Hazeel]], an ancient and powerful follower of Zamorak who was killed by an ancestor of Ceril. He will ask for your help in reviving Hazeel. '''Accept.'''\n\nThe first thing you need to do is kill a member of the Carnillean family. Go to the basement of Ceril's house, and use the bottle of poison that he gives you on the range. Then, go upstairs and talk to the Carnilleans to learn that Scruffy the dog is dead.\n[[File:Hazeel Cult map.png|thumb|250px|Valve locations]]\nTalk to Clivet again to begin the next part of the ritual. He'll give you the [[Hazeel's mark|Mark of Hazeel]] (looks like a golden [[unholy symbol]]), then tell you to find the cult hideout. You need to find five [[Sewer valve]]s and turn them the proper direction.\n*'''Valve 1''' - This is right across the bridge south of the Carnilleans' house. Turn it <u>'''right'''</u>.\n*'''Valve 2''' - This is right behind Carnilleans' house. Turn it <u>'''right'''</u>.\n*'''Valve 3''' - This is north of the cave.

Turn it <u>'''right'''</u>.\n[[File:Hazeel revived.gif|thumb|200px|Hazeel emerges from his coffin.]]\n\nGo back to the cave and board the raft. Once you're in the main hideout, talk to [[Alomone]]. He'll tell you to find a scroll. Go back to the Carnilleans' house.\n\nTalk to [[Butler Jones]]; then, search the crates in the basement for a key. Go up the ladder and stairs and knock on the wall in the east room, and go up the ladder. Unlock the chest to get the scroll; then, return to Alomone. Hazeel will be resurrected, and you'll be rewarded.{{Clear}}\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Hazeel Cult\n|image = [[File:Hazeel Cult reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n*1500 {{Skill clickpic|thieving}} [[Thieving]] [[experience]]\n*2000 [[coins]]\n*[[Hazeel's mark|Mark of Hazeel]] (if you sided with [[Hazeel]])\n}}\n\n{{Hazeel Cult}}\n[[Category:Quests]]"], "Heroes' Quest": ["{{External|rs|rsc}}{{Has quick guide}}{{Floor}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Heroes' Quest\n|image = [[File:Heroes' Guild.png|300px]]\n|number = 22\n|members = Yes\n|release = 27 February [[2002]]\n|update = Latest RuneScape News (27 February 2002)\n|series = Guild\n|difficulty = Experienced\n|developer = Paul Gower\n}}\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Outside the [[Heroes' Guild]]; north of [[Taverley]].

Players that have completed the quest may go back and help others. For finding a quest partner, the [[Minigame Group Finder]] is useful. You can also usually find a partner of the [[clan chat]] 'Osrs Soa' during peak hours.\n:'''Note:''' You '''do not''' need to meet the quest's skill requirements ([[Cooking]], [[Fishing]], [[Herblore]], [[Mining]]) in order to complete this part of the quest. This means that you can obtain help from someone who does not meet these requirements, or complete it ahead of time yourself if you do not meet those requirements. You can also partner up with someone if you have finished the quest - see [[Heroes' Quest#Trivia|Trivia]] for more details.\n:'''Note:''' Traded Pete's candlesticks will not be accepted if the presenter did not kill Grip. As such, do not not get scammed into buying or taking free candlesticks unless you are a Phoenix Gang member and can kill Grip. Black Arm gang members can never kill Grip so they should not accept traded candlesticks under any circumstances. Likewise, a miscellaneous key without a Black Arm to lure Grip is useless. Do not get scammed into buying Miscellaneous keys. \n\n====Black Arm Gang members====\n'''''Items required:''' A [[black full helm]], a [[black platebody]] and [[black platelegs]].''\n[[File:Heroes' Quest ScarFace Pete's mansion.png|frame|The location of ScarFace Pete's mansion in Brimhaven.]]\nThe [[black full helm]] and [[black platelegs]] can be purchased from the [[Champions' Guild]] and the [[black platebody]] can be obtained from [[Horvik's Armour Shop]] in [[Varrock]].\n\nGo to Varrock and talk to [[Katrine]] who is just west of the south Varrock entrance. She will tell you the gang's password which is \"''four leafed clover\".'' She will tell you that you have to steal [[ScarFace Pete]]'s [[Pete's candlestick|candlesticks]] who is in [[Brimhaven]].\n\nGo to Brimhaven and find '''the gang office''', which is the building along the fence, east of the bar and south of the [[Brimhaven Agility Arena|Agility Arena]]. Talk to [[Trobert]] who is in the building south of the agility arena, and he will give you some [[id papers]], which you will need to get into ScarFace Pete's mansion.\n\nEquip the black full helm, black platebody and black platelegs; then, go to the mansion. When you try to enter ScarFace Pete's Mansion, you will be stopped by [[Garv]]. Show him the id papers, and he will let you pass.\nOnce inside, talk to [[Grip]] and ask him what your duties involve; then, ask him if there is anything you can do. He will give you a [[miscellaneous key]] (has to be done for those who've already done the quest if the key isn't banked). '''Leave the building and give the key to your [[Phoenix Gang]] partner.'''\n\nIf Grip won't hand you the key, it is because you have one in your inventory or in the bank. Since the miscellaneous key is tradeable, players often drop them in banks and other players will pick them up.\n[[File:Heroes' Quest - Attacking Grip.png|thumb|250px|A player attacking [[Grip]].]]\nBack inside, head into the northeastern room of the entrance. Wait for your partner to be on the other side of the wall (on the east side); then, search the cupboard. A guard will tell you that Grip really doesn't like his drinks being touched; ignore the guard's comments. Grip will then come into the room, yelling at you to get your hands off them.\n\nYour Phoenix Gang partner will then kill Grip through the slot in the hidden room. If Grip backs away from your partner, search the cupboard again to get him back into position. Once he dies, pick up the key he drops. Grip will avoid walking through other characters and will always prioritise heading west in the room when struck so it is advised to create a path free of guards (you may kill the guards) into the room and make sure that there is space for Grip to walk west in the room. Otherwise, Grip will exit the room and you will have to search the cupboard again.\n\nUsing the key, go to the treasure room (the {{FloorNumber|1}} room with coins on the floor next to the stair case in the North-West corner) and open the North chest in the first room to receive two candlesticks. '''Give one candlestick to your Phoenix Gang partner.''' Go back to Varrock and talk to Katrine. She will give you the [[Thieves' armband]].\n:'''Note:''' The door to the treasure room will not open and give  you a message if you attempt to open it with Grip's keyring without having obtained a miscellaneous key at least once. \n:'''Note:''' The chest containing Pete's Candlesticks (position to the North), will be empty if you have a Pete's Candlestick in your inventory or bank. If you have a traded Pete's Candlestick in the bank, you will need to discard it then come back to search this chest as you will not be able to turn in a traded Pete's Candlestick to Katrine at any time.  \n:'''Note:''' Be sure to pick up the candlesticks yourself; otherwise, Katrine will say you weren't the one to retrieve the candlestick and you will have to go back to do it all over again.\n\n====Phoenix Gang members====\n'''''Items required:''' A [[bow]] and [[arrows]] ([[brutal arrows]] '''will not''' work) or [[runes]] for [[Magic]].''\n\nHead to [[Varrock]], and speak to [[Straven]] at the hideout to get the password for [[Alfonse the waiter|Alfonse]]. Get a [[bow]] and [[arrows]] before heading to [[Brimhaven]]. '''First, get the [[miscellaneous key]] from your [[Black Arm Gang]] partner.'''\n\nGo to [[The Shrimp and Parrot]] bar (not the southern bar) in Brimhaven. Once you are there, talk to Alfonse the waiter and then to [[Charlie the cook]]. Give them the password. Charlie the cook will tell you about secret wall that you are able to push. The pushable wall is in the kitchen, same place as where Charlie is, near where you will see some [[guard dog]]s.\n\nGet past these and into the mansion by the western door. Once inside, use the miscellaneous key on the northern door. This brings you in a closet with a window into a room with a cupboard. Shoot through the hole in the wall at [[Grip]] and kill him with [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]. He will drop the key for your Black Arm Gang partner.\n\n'''Your Black Arm Gang partner will get two [[Pete's candlestick|candlesticks]] and should trade you one of them.''' Go back to Varrock, and talk to Straven to get the [[Thieves' armband]].\n\n'''NOTE: You must kill Grip! If you don't, Straven will NOT accept your candlestick.'''\n\n===Fire feather===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Ice Gloves]] or a pickaxe and combat equipment if you do not already own a pair.''\n\nIn order to pick up the [[fire feather]], you'll need [[ice gloves]]. They are dropped by the level 111 [[Ice Queen]] located underneath [[White Wolf Mountain]].\n\n'''If you already have a pair of [[ice gloves]]''', simply equip them, travel to [[Entrana]], and defeat the [[Entrana firebird|firebird]] to obtain the feather.\n\nIf you do not already own Ice gloves, go to White Wolf Mountain (east of [[Catherby]], west of [[Taverley]]). Enter the mountain at the southern entrance, and walk or run north until you come to a rock slide. Use a [[pickaxe]] on the rock slide and go through it (this requires 50 [[Mining]]). Once you are through, you will be near level 57 [[ice warrior]]s and three ladders.\n[[File:Heroes' Quest - Rockslide.png|thumb|250px|Compass pointing north; location of the rockslide to get into the lair.]]\n\n[[File:Ice Queen's Lair.png|thumb|220px|The [[Ice Queen's Lair]]]]\n\nUse the southern ladder and go down the southwestern tunnel. Go up the ladder just after the tunnel bends north. Once you go up, you will see level 53 [[ice giant]]s there. Take the eastern ladder down. Go north through the long tunnel with level 61 [[ice spider]]s and ice giants (the spiders in the tunnel do not show up on [[minimap]]). The tunnel makes a loop and ends at a ladder. Go up the ladder, then go down the other. Continue down the tunnel until it opens up into a large room full of ice warriors and the Ice Queen. Be careful because this is a [[multicombat area]], so you will be attacked by multiple enemies at once!\n\nIf you stand behind the throne, you can avoid the ice warriors and can still attack the Ice Queen if positioned right. Kill her and she will drop the ice gloves. Once you have the gloves, exit using the same route back or teleport out.\n\nBank your weapons and armour, but keep your ice gloves. Head to [[Port Sarim]] and talk to the [[Monk of Entrana]] to travel to Entrana or teleport to Castle Wars and use the hot air balloon to go there. Go to the northeastern part of the island to find the Entrana firebird. Kill it and it will drop the fire feather. Make sure to have the ice gloves equipped before picking it up.\n\n===Cooked lava eel===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[fishing rod]], [[fishing bait]], Dusty key (if you don't have 70 Agility), [[harralander potion (unf)]] (or a [[harralander]] and [[vial of water]]), and a slashing weapon or knife (only if going to Lava Maze in Wilderness).''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' [[Energy potion|energy]]/[[stamina potion]]s, fishing boost (if needed).''\n\nGo to [[Port Sarim]] and talk to [[Gerrant]] at the [[fishing shop]]. He will give you a bottle of [[blamish snail slime]]. Once you have the items, make sure you have\u00a0[[fishing bait]]\u00a0in your inventory while doing this - use the [[Harralander]] with the [[vial of water]] and then the [[Harralander potion (unf)|unfinished potion]] with the blamish snail slime.\u00a0Right-click the [[blamish oil]] and use it on a normal [[fishing rod]] to get an [[oily fishing rod]].\n\nThere are '''two possible locations''' where you can catch [[Raw lava eel|lava eels]]: the [[Taverley Dungeon]] or the [[Wilderness]] [[Lava Maze]]. It takes somewhat longer to reach the lava eel [[fishing spot]] in the Taverley Dungeon (if you don't have 70 or 63 [[Agility]] to skip the throwing axe room), but it's safer than travelling to levels 40-45 in the Wilderness to reach the Lava Maze. Don't forget your dusty key!\n\n:'''Note:''' Lava eels do not burn when cooked. Do not worry about obtaining multiple eels if you are worried about burning one.\n\n====Lava Maze====\n'''''Items required:''' A [[knife]] or a [[slash weapon]], [[oily fishing rod]], [[fishing bait]].''\n[[File:Lava Maze map.png|thumb|220px]]\n:'''<font color=\"red\">Warning:</font>''' The [[Lava Maze]] is located in deep [[Wilderness]]. Beware of any [[player killer]]s. You may likely lose any quest items you are carrying and may end up needing to gather the items to make another [[oily fishing rod]]. Make sure to bring some food in case someone does try to kill you.\n\nIf you're going to the [[Fishing spots|fishing spot]] in the [[Lava Maze]], there are several methods to reach there:\n\n*Teleporting there with the [[burning amulet]]. This is the quickest way.\n*Casting the [[Ghorrock Teleport]] spell (or [[Ghorrock teleport|tablet]]) in the [[Ancient Magicks]] spellbook, although this requires completing the quest [[Desert Treasure]].\n*Use a [[Canoe|Waka Canoe]] from [[Edgeville]] into the Wilderness. This requires 57 [[Woodcutting]]. From there, simply walk west to arrive near the entrance.\n*Use the [[Wilderness Obelisk]]s to arrive in level 35 or 44 Wilderness. Either teleport will place you close to the entrance of the maze.\n\nMake your way through the aggressive [[black knight]]s at the entrance.

Go up the staircase in the main part of the castle, and go to the south-east room (not the tower); he will appear once you enter. He tells you to go talk with someone on a \"holy island\" ([[Entrana]]), and [[Sir Galahad]].\n\n===The Island of Entrana===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Camelot teleport]] (optional but recommended), charged [[amulet of glory]] for quick travel to [[Draynor Village]] (optional but recommended)/[[Draynor manor teleport]] tablet. You can also use the [[minigame teleport]] to [[Pest Control]] (40 [[Combat]] required), and take the boat back to [[Port Sarim]] saving time if you do not own a glory. Remember not to take any [[weapons]] or [[armour]].\n\nNow, go to [[Port Sarim]], and speak to the monks on the pier to sail to [[Entrana]]. Remember not to take any [[weapons]] or [[armour]], or the monks will not grant you access to Entrana. Speak to the [[High Priest (Entrana)|high priest]] of the church. He will say the holy grail is no longer here. Then, a [[Crone|strange old crone]] will appear and say that [[Fisher King]] is in trouble. You will need to find six stone heads around the world, and go to where they point when you have a [[magic whistle]].\n[[File:Location galahad-house.png|left|thumb|200px|Galahad's house west of McGrubor's Woods and Camelot.]]\n[[File:Holy Grail - Taking the Whistle.png|thumb|200px|Taking the magic whistle.]]\n\nReturn to [[Camelot]]\u00a0(you can teleport or use a [[combat bracelet]] to teleport to the [[Ranging Guild]]); then, go to [[Galahad]] who's located in a house west of [[McGrubor's Wood]]. Tell him you're looking for an item from the [[Fisher Realm]], and he will reluctantly give you a [[holy table napkin]], a souvenir he took from the Fisher Realm.\n\nNow, head to the top floor of [[Draynor Manor]]\u00a0into the southern room by [[Professor Oddenstein]]. You need to have the holy table napkin with you, or you can't see the whistle respawn. Pick up two magic whistles.\n\n===Black Knight Titan===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Excalibur]], [[magic whistle]], 60+ [[coins]], [[Camelot teleport]], [[food]], a [[weapon]], and [[armour]] (last 4 are optional but highly recommended). A [[halberd]] gives [[Melee]] users the ability to defeat the titan without suffering damage. Bring [[anti-poison]] if you're under level 41 [[Combat]].''\n[[File:Holy grail 6.png|thumb|200px|The location on the minimap.]]\nNow, get ready to fight! The fastest way to [[Brimhaven]] is using a scroll of redirection on a teleport to house tablet and directing it to Brimhaven. The second best method is teleporting to [[Ardougne]] and talking to [[Captain Barnaby]] in southern [[Ardougne]], on the docks. You can also take a [[charter ship]] to Brimhaven from [[Port Sarim]] and the [[Catherby]] docks, this costs 1,600 gp. You can also use your [[amulet of glory]] to teleport to the [[Karamja Volcano]] and run west, or use [[fairy ring]] code {{fairycode|BLP}} to go to [[Tzhaar city]], inside the volcano.\n\nAfter arriving in Brimhaven, head north-west of the town, where the [[North Brimhaven mine|goldmine]] is. Look for a guard tower north of where the [[gold rock]]s are. Go under the tower and blow one of the magic whistles, and you will be teleported to the [[Fisher King's Realm]]. If you are below [[Combat level]] 41, be sure to bring [[Antipoison]] because there are level 20 [[poisonous]] [[scorpion]]s.\n[[File:Holy Grail - Fighting Black Knight Titan.png|thumb|250px|Fighting the Black Knight Titan.]]\nNow, you need to get across a bridge to speak to the [[Fisher King]]. The\u00a0[[Black Knight Titan]] stands there and won't let you through without a match. The Titan can hit up to 15, so be prepared. The titan must be killed with the [[Excalibur]] blade only, although you may use other weapons to bring down his health (it is possible to kill him with a different weapon, however you must quickly switch to [[Excalibur]]). The titan has no specific weakness to an [[attack style]], but he is resistant to [[Ranged]] and [[Magic]] attacks, hence it is recommended to use [[Melee]]. If the finishing strike is not from the Excalibur, you will have to face him again. (If you have a low level combat, it is possible to use the [[hit-and-run]] method, as the titan does not move. You can simply hit him once and then walk a square back.) If you use a [[halberd]], you can just defeat him from a block away. (You can [[safe-spot]] with magic, stand 4 units east, and 1 unit north from the titan.)\n\nAfter you have killed the titan, cross the bridge and head south along the river till you find a [[Fisherman (Holy Grail)|fisherman]].\n\nSpeak to him and ask how to get inside the castle. He will tell you that you need to ring a bell. Head to the castle (south-west from the fisherman), and there will be a grail bell on the ground in front of the entrance. Ring it, progress through the dialogue, and you will be inside the castle.\n\nHead upstairs and speak to the Fisher King. Choose every chat option because if you miss one, you may have to kill the titan again. He is very sick and wishes to see his son once more. The son's name is [[Percival]], and he is a knight of the round table. Now, blow your whistle again to be teleported out, or teleport directly to [[Camelot]] if you have the runes. Although possible, you should NOT use the [[fairy ring]] {{Fairycode|BJR}}, if used before talking to Percival, you will NOT be able to grab the grail. (You will be in the Fisherman Realm era with Percival as King, however.)\n===Finishing up===\n'''''Items required:''' 30+ [[coins]], both [[magic whistle]]s, [[Falador teleport]], [[Camelot teleport]], and [[Ardougne teleport]] (all teleports are optional but highly recommended) or [[fairy rings]] teleport.''\n\nHead to [[Camelot]], and speak to [[King Arthur]]. Though he does not know where [[Percival]] is, he gives you a [[magic gold feather]], which points to the gold boots Percival was wearing.\n\nBlow on the feather, and it will guide you towards [[Goblin Village]]. Teleport to [[Falador]], and head north. Once at the Goblin Village, head into the east house and open (do not just prod) the sacks, and you will find Sir Percival. Tell him that his father wishes to see him. Percival doesn't know how to get to the castle; if you have a magic whistle in your inventory, you will automatically give it to him when the conversation ends.\n[[File:Holy Grail - Talking to Sir Percival.png|thumb|[[Sir Percival]]|200px]]\nHead back to the Fisher King's Realm like before (you don't need to fight the [[Black Knight Titan]] this time). You may now also teleport there using [[fairy rings]] ({{Fairycode|BJR}}) after finding and giving him the whistle. Now, head to where the [[Fisher King]] should have been, and you find Percival as a king.\n[[File:Holy Grail - Taking the grail.png|thumb|left|Take the [[Holy grail (item)|Holy grail]].]]\nHead back downstairs, go up the staircase on the east end of the castle, and continue up the ladder. Now, you can take the [[Holy grail (item)|holy grail]]. Then, blow your whistle.\n\nHead back to King Arthur in Camelot, and talk to him.\n\n'''Congratulations!

If you do it right, you can get the [[Dagannoth Mother|mother]] stuck behind a stalagmite where you can stand behind and not lose any health points.\n\nThe best way to defeat her is to ignore the ranged and melee forms, since she has too high [[Defence]] against those attack types for them to be worthwhile. Use an [[air staff]] and switch spell types in the correct order.\n\nThe Mother can be safespotted by melee, and if you have a good enough weapon (e.g. [[dragon weapons]]), you can completely avoid all Ranged and Magic; you don't need food or decent armour, and you can wait until the orange stage repeatedly.\n\n[[Protect from Missiles]] can be flicked as you safespot her, which will cause her to do no attacks at all. [[Bolt spells|Bolt]] and [[Blast spells]] will tear through her, requiring no food at all.\n\nShe can detect [[Prayer]], and will automatically use the opposite attack type when you use prayer. By default, she ranges at a distance and melees up close.

Make sure you are prepared.\n\nEvery now and again during the quest, you'll experience a flashback where you remember what you did while you were hypnotised. You need to play through these in order to progress through the quest.\n\n'''<u>Important note</u>: Using the mini-map to navigate the pyramid will automatically avoid the traps (both the wall-crushers and pit traps) and is much more time efficient than manually navigating it.'''\n\nTouch the door of the [[Klenter's Pyramid|pyramid]] to begin the first flashback. During the flashback, you will need to go through the pyramid. You'll see some wall crushers. Stand on the opposite wall and don't go next to\u00a0them, as they will damage you if you do. Once you're past the crusher blocks, you'll find pit traps in the next hallway. If you step on the wrong spot, you'll fall into a pit and end up at the beginning of the pyramid. You can move forward by clicking on the map, and your character will avoid the traps automatically. To avoid traps, stay along the left wall until you pass the whitish rectangle on the wall, and then go to the right side. Continue walking until you are opposite a square. Go back to the left side until you pass a candle. Switch to the right wall once more.\n[[File:Icthlarin's Little Helper - The Pit.png|thumb|220px|The pit.]]\nYou'll see [[mummies]] (level 84). They will attack you; simply go past them. You'll also see [[Scarab swarm]]s (level 96) crack out of the ground. They hit 2 damage on you really fast and can do a 2 damage [[poison]] condition. Continue to some more wall crushers. Past these\u2014you'll eventually find a large pit. Jump over it. (You'll need 20% run energy\u2014it is recommended you have both hands free when attempting the jump. If you fail, you'll reappear near the second set of wall crushers.)\n[[File:Icthlarin's Little Helper - Puzzle.png|thumb|left|220px|The Puzzle.]]\n[[File:Icthlarin's Little Helper - Puzzle solution.png|thumb|220px|Solution]]\nGo to the west door and try to open the door. Now, you need to solve a puzzle. The objective is to flip all of the tiles onto their gold sides. There is no required number of flips that you must make, nor is there any limit of tries. Each time you flip a tile, the nine tiles in a 3x3 grid will also flip. To solve this puzzle click on the squares in the order shown on the image below (make sure the puzzle is in the default position as shown below. To get to the default position, right click on the gold solution to reset.).\nOnce you've solved it, you'll wake up fully healed outside the pyramid.\n\n===After Flashback 1===\nAfter you finish the flashback, talk to the [[Sphinx]] with your [[cat]] out. Ask for help and the Sphinx will ask you this question: \"A husband and a wife have 6 sons. Each son has a sister. How many people are in the family?\" The answer is 9 (each brother has a sister, since they're related there can only be one sister. 6 + 1 + 2 parents = 9). '''If you guess wrong, you will lose your cat!'''\u00a0Once answered correctly, you will receive the [[Sphinx's token]], so you can speak to the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]].\n\nGo to the High Priest, located in the south-west corner of the city, and ask him about the remains. He will tell you to put them back in the burial chamber.\n\nReturn to the [[Klenter's Pyramid|pyramid]], and select open door. Your cat will help you get back inside. Go through the pyramid using the same steps as in the first flashback. Before you jump the pit examine the canopic jar in your inventory so you know which one to choose later. When you jump across the pit, you'll enter the second flashback.\n\n===Flashback 2===\n[[File:Icthlarin's Little Helper - Attacking the Guardian.png|thumb|220px|Attacking the guardian.]]\nThe second flashback begins where the first one left off\u2014on the other side of the pit. Open the unlocked door of the west room. Examine the four jars to find which one you used to have in your inventory. If you don't remember, just try them all. The player will only take the correct one. As soon as you try to pick up your jar, a guardian will attack you. It can be anywhere from level 75 to level 81. It attacks with [[Magic]] and [[Melee]]. Use the [[Protect from Magic]] prayer or take off your [[armour]] to kill it with melee. Once you've defeated it, pick up the jar. Leave the room and jump across the pit again. The flashback ends.\n\n===Returning the canopic jar===\n[[File:Icthlarin's Little Helper - Puzzle solution (2).png|thumb|left|220px|Reset the puzzle to look like this.]]\n[[File:Icthlarin's Little Helper - Puzzle solution.png|thumb|220px|Solve the puzzle by pressing the squares in the order indicated by the numbers]]\nAfter the flashback is over, you will feel regret and you will say to yourself that you think you should put \nthe jar back. Jump the pit and go to the west door. You will need to solve the same door puzzle to enter the room. Once you turn all of the tiles to their gold side; you will automatically enter the room. Drop the [[canopic jar]] where you found it and go back through the [[Klenter's Pyramid|pyramid]], across the pit, past the monsters, and past the traps to the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]].\n\n===The High Priest===\nTalk with the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]]. He will ask you to prepare a ceremony. You will need to help the [[Embalmer]] and the [[Carpenter]]. If you used [[Protect from magic|Protect from Magic]] during the fight, recharge your prayer points at the altar here.\n\n===The embalmer===\nFind the [[Embalmer]] in the building south of the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]], near the water symbol,\u00a0and talk to him. He will ask for a [[bucket of sap]], [[linen]], and a [[bag of salt]]. The salt can be found by using an empty [[bucket]] on the pond north of [[Sophanem]] and then using the full bucket on the centre piece east of the embalmer, and buckets of sap can be obtained by using a [[knife]] with an [[evergreen]] while you have a bucket. Tell him you will get the items later.\n\n===The carpenter===\nThen, head to the city's eastern side to find the [[Carpenter]], who can be found east of\u00a0the bakery stall. He needs a [[willow log]] to make a [[Holy symbol (Icthlarin's Little Helper)|holy symbol]]. Talk to him again to give him your willow log. After the quest, the Carpenter will buy willow logs from you at 40 [[coins]] each in groups of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20. Next, head a bit north to talk to [[Raetul]], who is wearing a purple headpiece. Buy a sheet of [[linen]] for 30 coins.\n\nThen, go back to the [[Embalmer]]. Give the three items to him. After the quest, the Embalmer will buy [[Bucket of sap|buckets of sap]] from you at 30 coins each in groups of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20.\n\nGo back to the Carpenter and he will give you the symbol.\n\n===Starting the ceremony===\nThe Carpenter or the Embalmer (whoever you helped last) will tell you that the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]] began the ceremony without you. To find him, go back into the [[Klenter's Pyramid|pyramid]] past the traps and the pit. As you cross the pit, the third flashback will begin.\n\n===Flashback 3===\nYou will now have an [[Unholy symbol (Icthlarin's Little Helper)|unholy symbol]] in your inventory. Your character tells you that your mistress wants it inside the [[Klenter's Pyramid|pyramid]] so she can teleport there. Enter the east room and use the symbol with any sarcophagus around the walls.\u00a0Leave the room and the flashback will end.\n\n===The ceremony===\n[[File:Icthlarin's Little Helper - The ceremony.png|thumb|220px|The Ceremony started and the player was too late.]]\nYou will speak to yourself again showing your regret for causing harm to the town. Jump across the pit again and re-enter the eastern burial chamber. After a cutscene, you'll learn that the [[Wanderer]] was behind it. She is really the Devourer, an evil goddess, and she'll possess one of the priests.\n\nYou will fight a level 91 [[Possessed Priest]]. You can use [[Protect from Magic]] and kill him. Once you have dealt with him he drops a four-dose [[Attack potion|attack]], [[Strength potion|strength]], [[Magic potion|magic]], [[Agility potion|agility]], or [[defence potion]] (Ironmen may wish to keep the agility potion if they plan on doing Tai Bwo Wannai Trio, should they receive it). Talk to the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]] again, and you will experience the last flashback.\n\n'''Note:''' If you take too long to defeat him, the message \"''The priest seems to have recovered from the Devourers spell''\" will appear, and you will have to exit the door and re-enter to face him again with full [[Hitpoints]].\n\n===Flashback 4===\n[[File:Icthlarin's Little Helper - Meeting Icthlarin.png|thumb|220px|Icthlarin, god of the dead stops the player from stealing.]]\nAfter talking to the High Priest, you will see the final flashback as a cut-scene. You will be escaping from the [[Klenter's Pyramid|pyramid]], and [[Icthlarin]], god of the dead, will dehypnotise you.\n\n===Finishing the quest===\nYou will find yourself back in the eastern burial chamber. Head outside and talk to the [[High Priest (Sophanem)|High Priest]] to complete the quest.\n\n'''Congratulations! Quest complete!'''\n\nIf you equip your [[catspeak amulet]] and then talk to your [[cat]] about being confused, you will unlock another cutscene! Talking with your cat again about being confused will tell you the story of the quest as it understands it. If asked again, your cat will refuse to explain it again and instead tells you to ask one of your adventuring buddies and the chat option will go away. \n\nPS: If you happen to have a Hellcat, you will lose your cat after the cutscene is over. You just have to logout and log back in for the cat to reappear. \n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Icthlarin's Little Helper\n|image = [[File:Icthlarin's Little Helper reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*4,500 {{Skill clickpic|Thieving}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*4,000 {{Skill clickpic|Agility}} [[Agility]] experience\n*4,000 {{Skill clickpic|Woodcutting}} [[Woodcutting]] experience\n*[[Catspeak amulet]]\n*Access to the city of [[Sophanem]]\n*Unlock the carpet rides from [[Pollnivneach]] to [[Sophanem]] and [[Menaphos]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompleting this quest is required for:\n* [[Ratcatchers]] \n* [[A Tail of Two Cats]]\n* [[Contact!]]\n* [[Rogue Trader]]\n\n{{Icthlarin's Little Helper}}\n[[Category:Intermediate quests]]"], "Imp Catcher": ["{{External|rs|rsc}}\n{{Floor}}\n{{Has quick guide}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Imp Catcher\n|image = [[File:Imp Catcher.png|300px]]\n|release = 16 February [[2001]]\n|update = Yet another new quest, and new options menu\n|members = No\n|number = 9\n|series = None\n|difficulty = Novice\n|developer = Paul Gower\n}}\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Speak to [[Wizard Mizgog]] on the top floor of the [[Wizards' Tower]].\n|difficulty = Novice\n|description = The Wizard Grayzag has summoned hundreds of little imps.

He will tell you that [[Wizard Grayzag]]'s [[imp]]s have stolen his beads and he wants you to get them back for him. He needs you to collect:\n*A [[black bead]]\n*A [[yellow bead]]\n*A [[red bead]]\n*A [[white bead]]\n\n===Obtaining beads===\nTo obtain the beads, you may buy them from the [[Grand Exchange]] for {{Coins|{{GEP|Red bead|1}} + {{GEP|Black bead|1}} + {{GEP|Yellow bead|1}} + {{GEP|White bead|1}}}}, receive them in a trade with another player, or you can simply kill imps instead. Imps can be found throughout [[Gielinor]]. There are several good spots to kill imps including: east of the [[Ardougne Monastery]], on top of the [[Karamja Volcano]] (be aware of level 14 [[scorpion]]s in this area), or by the southern entrance to [[Falador]]. Imps may teleport away when in combat making them harder to kill, beads are also an uncommon drop, thus many players will often trade for beads instead to avoid the hassle of finding the beads themselves. \n\nOnce you have all four beads, return to Wizard Mizgog and give them to him to finish the quest.

Keep at least 6 inventory spaces semi-free. If you have completed [[Shades of Mort'ton]] you can get the hammer and planks from the [[Mort'ton]] [[Razmire Builders Merchants|builder shop]].''\n\n[[Burgh de Rott]] does not have a functional bank at the beginning of this quest; Canifis is the closest available bank. You will repair the Burgh de Rott's bank, general store, and bar throughout the course of the quest.\n\nBefore you travel, you should make sure that you have what you need to complete the next part of the quest.\n\nYou will be '''attacked by aggressive shades''' when in Mort'ton if you have a lower combat level.\n\n5 buckets are optimal in order to minimise the number of trips to and from the pub's basement, but you can use one bucket if inventory space is a priority. Buckets spawn just west of the well in Burgh de Rott.\n\nYou have several options of travelling from Canifis to Burgh de Rott. You could teleport to the ''[[Shades of Mort'ton (minigame)|Shades of Mort'ton]] ''minigame if you have completed ''Shades of Mort'ton. ''You could use the boat shortcut you first used in the previous quest. If you have at least 50 [[Agility]], you could use the fairy ring {{fairycode|BIP}}, which bypasses the swamp and avoids nearly all of the ghasts. Alternatively, you could run through the swamp again.\n\nTo return to Canifis from Burgh de Rott, you could use the fairy ring {{fairycode|cks}}, a slayer ring, the [[Kharyrll Teleport]] (remember to switch back to the [[standard spellbook]] afterward), an [[ectophial]],'' ''or the boat shortcut.\n\n===Arrival at Burgh de Rott===\nWhen you arrive in Mort'ton (the town closest to Burgh de Rott), head south to find angry residents at the gate. Before being able to enter, first talk to Florin from the outside of the gate and then deposit your food item into the open chest directly in front of the gate. Florin will then let you into the town. You are now out of danger from shades.\n[[File:In_Aid_of_the_Myreque_-_clearing_basement_entrance.png|thumb|270px|Clearing the rubble from the basement entrance.]]\nOnce inside, talk to [[Florin]] again regarding 'out of the way' places. [[Razvan]], who can be usually found near the pub, will tell you to clear out 15 piles of rubble from the basement.\n\n===Clearing out the bar===\nGo to the pub just south of the gate, climb over the broken down wall, and mine the rubble by using your pickaxe on it. There is a bucket spawn near the well south of the front gate if you forgot. You can [[world hop]] to pick up additional buckets quickly, 5 buckets will make this faster. When you have at least one bucket, climb down the ladder.\n\nMine each pile of rubble, and then use a spade on the remaining debris to fill [[bucket of rubble|buckets of rubble]]. Each bucket can contain 3 loads worth of rubble.\n\nWhen the buckets are filled, empty them into the rubble pile outside the bar. You can search the big pile of rubble outside of the pub when you're done to receive the [[dusty scroll]] and [[plaster fragment]]. You can read both items, but they are not needed to complete this quest. [[File:In_Aid_of_the_Myreque_-_clearing_rubble.png|thumb|270px|left|Mining rubble from the basement.]]Every few rubble piles you mine, you will get 6 items that you must make room for: [[nail]]s (10 [[bronze nails|bronze]], 5 [[iron nails|iron]], 3 [[steel nails|steel]], 2 [[black nails|black]], 1 [[mithril nails|mithril]]), 1 [[Rock (limestone)|rock]], and 1 [[broken glass]]. You can drop these, however, black nails in particular sell for a decent price on the [[Grand Exchange]].\n\n'''If you drop items to make room for the junk, they will disappear if you exit the basement. If you only mine the rocks to rubble and exit the area, the rubble will be restored to rocks and you will have to mine them again.'''\n\nAfter you are finished mining all of the rubble, there will be a cutscene of you noticing a plaque on the wall. The plaque holds no significance for this quest.\n\nGo and talk to [[Razvan]] again, and he will tell you to patch up the town a bit.\n\n===Repairing the general store===\nTalk to [[Aurel]] in the general store, and he will tell you that you need to repair the roof and the walls of the shop.[[File:In_Aid_of_the_Myreque_-_repairing_general_store.png|thumb|270px|Repairing Aurel's general store.]]Go back to the shop, and use the planks on both the roof and the walls of the shop to repair it. Then, talk to [[Aurel]] again - he will want the store stocked before he can open it.\n\n''You will be given a [[Crate (In Aid of the Myreque)|crate]] to fill up with these items.''\n\n'''''He requires the following:'''''\n*10-12 [[bronze axe]]s\n*10 [[raw mackerel]] '''or''' 10 [[snail]]s (depending on what is asked)\n*3 [[tinderbox]]es\nYou will now need to visit a bank.

Any type works.\n\nReturn to [[Aurel]] in Burgh de Rott. Talk to [[Razvan]] again, and then talk to [[Cornelius]] in the bank to the south of the city. He will ask that the bank is repaired.\n\n===Repairing the bank===\n[[File:In_Aid_of_the_Myreque_-_fixing_bank_booth.png|thumb|220px|Repairing Burgh de Rott's bank booth.]]\nTo repair the bank, you will need a hammer, five planks and one swamp paste, as well as 20 nails.\n\nRepair the teller window (the broken glass in the booth) by using your planks on the bank booth with swamp paste in your inventory, and then the wall at the back of the bank as you did before. Then, ask [[Cornelius]] what to do, and '''in the same conversation''' ask him: ''Do you fancy the job?''.\n\n'''You will now be able to use the bank.'''\n\n===Repairing the furnace===\n'''Items needed:''' ''a [[hammer]]'', ''2 [[steel bar]]s, 1 piece of [[coal]], 1 [[tinderbox]], [[Efaritay's aid]] or a [[silver]] weapon such as the [[Silver sickle (b)]], and some food for lower-levelled players.''[[File:In_Aid_of_the_Myreque_-_repairing_furnace.png|thumb|Repairing Burgh de Rott's furnace.]]\n*Talk to [[Razvan]] again, he will ask that you fix the furnace.\n*Take two [[steel bar]]s, a [[tinderbox]], a [[hammer]] and one [[coal]] and repair the furnace to the south-east side of the city. Bring your [[silver]] weapon along with you.\n*Use a steel bar on the broken furnace to repair it.\n*Put the coal inside of the newly fixed furnace, and light it with the tinderbox. You will then see a cutscene.\n[[File:Inaid cutscene.png|thumb|220px|Vanstrom notices the furnace has been lit!]]\n*After the cutscene, you will need to prepare for a fight with your [[silver]] weapon '''or''' any weapon wearing the ring. Go to the general store, and talk to [[Gadderanks]] and then [[Wiskit]]. Talk to one of the [[Vampyre Juvinate]]s and Gadderanks will try to kill you.\n*Kill Gadderanks (he's fairly easy), and then kill the Vampyre juvinates with your silver weapon. During the fight, Veliaf will come and assist you by taking on one of the vampyres.\n*Talk to Gadderanks again, and he will tell you of the vampyre's weaknesses and then die. You will get his [[Gadderhammer|hammer]], which is similar to a [[Granite maul]] but stronger against [[Shade]]s. (If your inventory has no room for the hammer, you can speak to [[Aurel]] to receive it later.)\n*Talk to [[Veliaf]], and he will tell you to meet him back at his [[Myreque Hideout|hideout]] in the [[Hollows]].\n\n===Transporting Ivan===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Armour]], [[food]] (also the salmon or snails if you got them), and a [[weapon]] (those that work are specified below) in order to defeat the [[vampyre]]s. You may now bring the steel equipment (med helm, chain, legs), including the sickle, but do not bring the food before entering Canifis, as ghasts will still rot the food on the way back to Canifis.''\n[[File:Inaid juvinates.png|thumb|220px|The player and Ivan are ambushed by juvinates.]]\n*Go back to [[Veliaf]], where you started the quest and talk to him again.\n*He will have you talk to [[Radigad]] and [[Polmafi]] to have them head to the [[Burgh de Rott]] hideout, but wants you to escort [[Ivan Strom]] to the [[Paterdomus Temple]] because the mission is becoming too dangerous for the young, aspiring priest.\n*You may also take some [[armour]], [[food]], and a [[weapon]] for Ivan, but remember that you will not get any of them back. Talk to Polmafi Ferdygris and Radigad Ponfit first, and after that \"use\" a [[steel chainbody]], [[steel platelegs]], [[steel med helm]], and a [[silver sickle]] on Ivan, who will accept your gifts and wear it under his robes. You may also provide food to him before you start; Ivan only likes \"cooked [[snail]]s, [[salmon]], cooked [[slimy eel]] or [[stew]].\"\n*Take armour and a silver weapon for yourself OR the ring mentioned earlier so you can use ANY weapon to kill vampyres. The [[Silver sickle (b)|blessed silver sickle]] has ''no attack stats'', so it is recommended to use the the [[Wolfbane]] dagger from [[Priest in Peril]], [[blessed axe]] from [[Animal Magnetism]] or the [[Silverlight]] from [[Demon Slayer]] ([[Darklight]] and [[Arclight]] also work).\nYou get to choose between two routes through [[Mort Myre Swamp]]. You will be attacked on both the 'long' and the 'short' routes. On the long route, you need to fight four level 50 [[Vampyre Juvinate]]s while on the short route, you'll be attacked by two level 75 ones. The 'short' route is probably easier than the 'long' route because it's easier to defend Ivan, despite the fact that you have a harder fight. If you can, try and get Ivan behind you so he can't be attacked by the juvinates.\n\n'''WARNING: The area is instanced; if you die, you will lose all your items except untradeables and the 3 most valuable items (4 if [[Protect Item]] [[Prayer]] is activated). Do not bring anything you don't want to risk losing!'''\n*'''Strategy:''' When you first enter the fight area, don't move. Bring any attack [[spell]] with you, and use it to lure the first vampyre to you and kill it. '''Remember to use your silver weapon to fight the vampyres OR equip the ring mentioned earlier!''' The second vampyre will always attack Ivan at the same point, so just hope that Ivan survives until you finish off the first one. It is possible to finish this part without giving Ivan anything, but it is difficult, and it will often require several attempts just to keep Ivan alive. Therefore, it is highly recommended to give Ivan armour and food. It should also be noted that Ivan does '''NOT''' receive protection from the player's [[Protect from Melee]] prayer.\n*If Ivan's health becomes too low (or after he runs out of food), he will teleport out. At this point, you might as well leave the area because killing the remaining vampyres will not let you progress. When you leave, you will reappear somewhere around [[Canifis]], so make your way back to where you spoke to Ivan to try again (make sure to collect food via the bank on your way back to him as he will need more). Once you defeat the vampyres, you will complete the trek and appear outside the Temple of the Salve.\n*If you take the short route with 2 level 75 Vampyre Juvinates, you can keep Ivan safe by walking west once the fight starts into a spot with 3 seaweeds surrounding it, and then keep walking back and forth to the east and west until Ivan decides to go into that spot. Wait for the Vampyre Juvinates to get close to you before attacking. This way, you can protect Ivan without giving him any supplies.\n\n===The rod of ivandis===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Hammer]], [[soft clay]], [[mithril bar]], [[silver bar]], 1 [[water rune]] (or [[water staff]]), 1 [[cosmic rune]] (make sure you have the normal spellbook activated for lvl-1 Enchant), a cut [[sapphire]], and a [[rope]]. (First go and talk to Drezel, you can bank later when you get back to canifis)''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' [[Ectophial]].''\n[[File:Paterdomus library.png|thumb|250px|right|Drezel's library.]]\n*After successfully escorting [[Ivan Strom|Ivan]], talk to [[Drezel]] (inside the temple) at the [[River Salve]], and get the [[Temple library key|key to the library]] from him (using chat option 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3). Mention that the lives of Morytania rest on his decision.\n[[File:Inaid coffin.png|thumb|220px|The tomb of Ivandis.]]\n[[File:Burgh de Rott basement.png|thumb|220px|The furnished basement, repurposed as a base of operations for the Myreque.]]\n*Search the keyhole on the east side of the room [[Drezel]] is in. Use your key on the keyhole. Go down the trapdoor into the library, and search all the bookcases to the west side to get all the books; the one you want is called \"[[Ancient book]]\", titled inside ''The Sleeping Seven''. The book tells you where to find [[Ivandis Seergaze|Ivandis]]' grave.\n*Go back to [[Canifis]], and enter the trapdoor behind the pub. Search the south wall. Now, directly to your east you should see two wooden boards covering an entrance - use a [[hammer]] on the boards to get through and you should see a tomb that looks like a coffin.\n*Use some [[soft clay]] on the top of the coffin to get a [[Rod clay mould]].\n*Go to a furnace (the closest one is [[Port Phasmatys]] after [[Ghosts Ahoy]]; using an [[Ectophial]] is the fastest way there. An alternative is to use the [[Zanaris]] furnace or the Burgh de Rott furnace you fixed earlier), and use a [[silver bar]], [[mithril bar]], and cut [[sapphire]] to make a [[Silvthrill rod]] and enchant it using [[Lvl-1 Enchant]].\n*Take the enchanted Silvthrill rod and a [[rope]] back to the Temple of the Salve, use the rod with the well (in the room next to Drezel) to create the [[Rod of ivandis|Rod of ivandis(10)]].\n*Take the Rod of ivandis to [[Burgh de Rott]], go into the cellar of the pub, and give it to [[Veliaf]] to complete the quest.{{Clear}}\n'''Congratulations!

He tells you about [[the Myreque]], an organisation fighting [[vampyre]]s, which is currently low on weapons and needs an arsenal of steel weapons to survive; Vanstrom doesn't have the time to bring the weapons to his friends he has never actually met yet. If you agree to help Vanstrom, he will also tell you about a boatman in [[Mort'ton]] who is rumoured to be able to show you the Myreque hideout.\n:'''Note:''' Make sure that you offer to help (and that your [[Quest journal]] indicates that you have started the quest) or else your trip to Mort'ton will be in vain.\n\n===Mort'ton===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Druid pouch]] (must have 5 charges),  [[Silver sickle (b)|blessed silver sickle]], 6 [[plank]]s, a [[hammer]], 225 [[steel nails]], the steel weapons, [[combat gear]] (for level 97 [[Skeleton Hellhound]]), 10 [[coins]] or [[Ring of charos (a)]].''\n\nGo to [[Mort'ton]]. You can walk on foot, but beware that the ghasts on the way will drain charges from your [[Druid pouch]]. Make sure to have plenty of charges because five items are needed in your pouch when you reach your destination. A way around this is to take six [[Mort myre fungus]] so that you can fill the pouch twice once you arrive in Mort'ton. Alternative methods of reaching Mort'ton include the [[Swamp Boaty]] located at [[The Hollows]], reachable on foot or with [[fairy ring]] {{Fairycode|bkr}} (closer to Canafis), {{Fairycode|bip}} (west of Mort'ton through the winding path), a [[Mort'ton teleport]], the [[Minigame Group Finder]] to [[Shades of Mort'ton (minigame)|Shades of Mort'ton]], or a [[Barrows teleport]].\n\n===Convincing Cyreg Paddlehorn===\n[[File:In_Search_of_the_Myreque_Cyreg.png|thumb|Cyreg's location, east of Mort'ton.]]Find [[Cyreg Paddlehorn]]. He is located on the eastern edge of Mort'ton, near his boat at the bridge leading to the Barrows. Attempt to persuade him to bring you to [[the Myreque]]. Cyreg will be very secretive about how to find them though, so you will have to choose the correct sequence of responses to make him feel guilty in order for him to allow you to use his boat. Choose the following responses in this order:\n#''Well, I guess they'll just die without weapons...''\n#''Resourceful enough to get their own steel weapons?''\n#''If you don't tell me, their deaths are on your head!''\n#''What kind of man are you to say that you don't care?''\n\nHe will agree to take you, but he needs three wooden [[plank]]s. They are sold in [[Razmire Builders Merchants]], [[Mort'ton]]'s [[general store]], but you must have (partially) completed [[Shades of Mort'ton]] and cured [[Razmire Keelgan]] with [[Serum 208]] to use it. When you give Cyreg the planks, he will give you directions and you can now finally board the boat, though he won't let you travel unless you are carrying your [[druid pouch]] with at least five charges and a [[Silver sickle (b)|blessed silver sickle]]. Also, be sure to take the [[Swamp Boaty]] by paying the 10 gold or using the [[ring of charos (a)]], or you won't be able to proceed later on in the quest.\n\n===Myreque===\n[[File:In Search of the Myreque - repairing bridge.png|thumb|250px|Repairing the rope bridge.]]\nOnce you land at [[The Hollows]], go north, avoiding the [[ghast]]s, until you see a strange tree. Climb up to see a damaged rope bridge. Mend the bridge as you walk along, which requires 75 [[steel nails]] per [[plank]] (225 steel nails total) and three [[plank]]s, and then climb down the other side of the bridge.\n\nGo north to the strange-looking hollow tree and talk to [[Curpile Fyod]] out front. Tell him you've brought the weapons for [[the Myreque]] and then answer some questions for him to prove that you are indeed telling the truth. If you fail to answer the questions correctly, you will be knocked unconscious and wake up at the boat again, but luckily the bridge will require no building the second time. Here are the answers to the possible questions:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Question\n!Answer\n|-\n|'' Name the only female member of the Myreque.''||Sani Piliu\n|-\n|''Who is the leader of the Myreque?''||Veliaf Hurtz\n|-\n|''What is the boatman's name?''||Cyreg Paddlehorn\n|-\n|''Who was previously a scholar?''||Polmafi Ferdygris\n|-\n|''What family is rumoured to rule over Morytania?''||Drakan\n|-\n|''Who is the youngest member of the Myreque?''||Ivan Strom\n|-\n|''What does Myreque mean?''||Hidden in Myre\n|}\n\nWhen you have correctly answered the guard's questions, circle around his tree to the north, and you will see a set of doors in the earth (they are unlocked after you've answered the questions). Enter and proceed north following the tunnel, but don't go all the way north to the wall. Instead, take a little east branch and right-click on the \"Squeeze-past stalagmite\" option to enter the secret cave of the Myreque.\n\nStart off by talking to [[Veliaf Hurtz|Veliaf]]; then, talk to all of the others before coming back to Veliaf. It isn't necessary to actually ask any questions of them (you don't need any more info to finish the quest); just say, \"Ok thanks\", and talk to another one.\n\nGo back and talk to Veliaf again. He will now accept your weapons, however...\n\n===Vanstrom Klause===\nWhen finished, give the weapons to [[Veliaf Hurtz|Veliaf]]. A [[cutscene]] ensues where a strange mist envelopes the room, and Veliaf realises that it is a [[vampyre]]. The mist shifts, revealing [[Vanstrom Klause]], the stranger you were trying to help. He kills [[Sani Piliu]] and [[Harold Evans]] with throwing knives and transforms into his vampyre form. After performing the murders, Vanstrom disappears, before summoning a level 97 [[Skeleton Hellhound]] (\"his little pet\") to finish off the remaining members. In order to regain [[the Myreque]]'s trust after having lured Vanstrom to them, you must kill the hellhound.\n[[File:Skeleton hellhound safe spot.png|thumb|The safespot for killing the hellhound with ranged attacks.]]\nThe hellhound only has 55 [[Hitpoints]], but hits fairly hard; lower levels should bring [[food]]. [[Magic]] is extremely effective compared to [[Melee]], as it has no Magic [[Defence]]. If you have access to [[Protect from Melee]], the fight will be much easier. If using Magic or [[Ranged]], you can [[safespot]] the hellhound by getting it stuck on the west side of the barrel located in the northeastern corner of the room. \n\nOn death, the hellhound will drop two [[Uncut ruby|uncut rubies]] and four [[big bones]]. Talk to Veliaf Hurtz, who'll say he needs to speak to his superior in order to instate you into the Myreque; you can also ask him more questions about the Myreque and Vanstrom. Finally, ask him how to leave the hideout; he tells you about a secret passage to [[Canifis]]. Leave the chamber, and search the wall at the end of the tunnel; it will open. Now, climb up the ladder.\n\n====The Myreque shortcut====\n{{Main|Myreque Hideout}}\n[[File:Myreque Shortcut.png|frame|centre|The dungeon underneath [[Hair of the Dog]] Inn houses the [[Myreque Hideout|Myreque's hideout]].]]\n[[File:Myreque Map for ISOM.png|thumb|200px|The Myreque shortcut can be accessed via the trapdoor behind the Canifis pub.]]\nYou will surface south of the tavern. The nearby trapdoor leads back to the cave, which you can use as an alternate route back to [[Mort'ton]] in the future.\n:'''Note:''' Exiting through the trap door is a requirement of the quest. Exiting through the [[fairy ring]] or other method will require travelling here again to complete the quest. You can not return by fairy ring until the quest is completed.\n\nProceed back into the tavern and seek out [[Vanstrom Klause]], only to find that Vanstrom isn't there but only a [[Stranger (In Search of the Myreque)|Stranger]].

Talk to [[Trufitus]], a native found in a small house a short distance northeast of the main village area. Ask him where everyone is, and he says that they've left the village.\n\nAsk him about how you can help, and he tells you that he needs several [[herb]]s to mix a [[potions|potion]] so that he can commune with the Gods. Tell him that you'll give it a try.\n:'''Note:''' You cannot collect all of the herbs at once. You will need to go back to talk with Trufitus each time.\n\n===Snake weed (green circle)===\nThe first herb that [[Trufitus]] needs is called [[snake weed]], and it apparently grows near water. Head south of the village, past several level 44 [[jungle spider]]s and level 32 [[Tribesman|tribesmen]], and then west towards the water. Near the ocean should be a Marshy Jungle Vine, so search it to get a [[grimy snake weed]] (might take 1\u20135 minutes, with a significant increase in speed as your [[Herblore]] level increases), which should be cleaned before talking to Trufitus again. Bring this back to Trufitus, and he should give you another clue.\n:'''Note:''' If you intend to do [[Legends' Quest]] and [[Zogre Flesh Eaters]], take three snake weeds to save yourself time later, four for the long path.\n\n===Ardrigal (orange circle)===\nHead north of [[Trufitus]]' hut until you reach a cliff, and then head east to a peninsula (marked on the map by an [[Shortcuts|agility shortcut]]) with several palm trees on it, and level 46 [[Harpie Bug Swarm]]s (they will attack you the entire time you're searching for the herb and can easily kill an unwary lower levelled player). Search a palm tree to find a [[grimy ardrigal]], clean the herb. Bring this herb back to Trufitus.\n:'''Note:''' If you intend to do [[Legends' Quest]], take two ardrigals to save yourself time later, three for long path.\n\n===Sito foil (yellow circle)===\n[[File:Jungle Potion sito foil.png|thumb|220px|The location of the [[sito foil]].]]\nThe next herb required for the potion just happens to grow well in areas that have recently been burned by fire, like a campfire. Go south of the village, and on the southern side of the fires should be an area of scorched earth. Search it to find the [[grimy sito foil]]. Now, clean the herb and give to [[Trufitus]].\n\n===Volencia moss (red circle)===\n[[File:Jungle Potion valencia moss.png|thumb|220px|The location of the [[volencia moss]].]]\nThis type of herb is commonly found clinging onto rocks that are constantly disturbed, much like a mining site. Head southeast of the hut until you reach a group of rocks and search an empty one to find the [[grimy volencia moss]]. Again, clean the herb and give it to [[Trufitus]].\n:'''Note:''' If you intend to do [[Fairytale I - Growing Pains]] take an extra volencia moss as you may need one for the quest.\n\n===Rogue's purse (blue circle)===\n[[File:Jungle Potion rogue's purse.png|thumb|220px|The location of the [[rogue's purse]].]]\nThe last herb that is needed to make the potion is known as [[rogue's purse]], and it can be found north of the village. Just head back to the cliffs to the north and then run around them along coastline until you reach a pile of rocks. Search them and enter the cave. Once inside the cave, run south past the level 53 [[Jogre]]s until you find a fungus-covered cave wall. Search it until you find the grimy rogue's purse, clean it, and you will have the final herb.\n:'''Note''': Consider collecting an extra rogue's purse if you plan on completing [[Zogre Flesh Eaters]] to save the extra trip.\n:'''Note''': Make sure not to return a rogue's purse dropped by a Jogre or Tribesman, or [[Trufitus]] will tell you that he needs a fresh one.\n:'''Note''': Killing a Jogre in this dungeon is a task for the Karamja easy diary.\n:\n:\n:Return to Trifutus with the final cleaned herb to complete the quest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Jungle Potion\n|image = [[File:Jungle Potion reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n*{{Skill clickpic|Herblore|775}} [[Herblore]] [[experience]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Jungle Potion is required for the following:\n*[[My Arm's Big Adventure]] - To work in the [[Tai Bwo Wannai Cleanup]] [[minigame]] during the quest\n*[[Shilo Village]]\n*[[Tai Bwo Wannai Trio]]\n*[[Zogre Flesh Eaters]]\n*Several tasks in the [[Karamja Diary]]\n\n==Trivia==\nDoing this quest immediately after the \"Druidic Ritual\" quest will get you to 1,037 [[Herblore]] [[experience]] and level 9 Herblore (and 117 Herblore experience away from level 10 Herblore).\n\n{{Jungle Potion}}"], "King's Ransom": ["{{External|rs}}\n{{Has quick guide}}{{Floor}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = King's Ransom\n|image = [[File:King's Ransom.png|300px]]\n|number = 128\n|members = Yes\n|release = 24 July [[2007]]\n|update = King's Ransom\n|series = [[Camelot quest series|Camelot]] (#3)\n|difficulty = Experienced\n|developer = Nancy J\n}}\n'''King's Ransom''' is the final [[quest]] in the [[Camelot quest series]].\n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Talk to the [[Gossip]], outside [[Sinclair Mansion]].\n|difficulty = 3\n|description = Life has been quiet at the Sinclair Mansion since you discovered the murderer... too quiet.

He will explain to you that the Sinclairs have packed up and left after incriminating [[Anna]] as Lord Sinclair's murderer. This, however, may not be the same person you proved to be guilty in [[Murder Mystery]]. Gossip will explain that one of the family members provided new evidence to prove Anna's guilt. He will then go on to explain that [[King Arthur]] and his knights disappeared at the same time as the family's departure. Agree to investigate, and you will start the quest.\n*Now, speak to the [[Guard (Sinclair Mansion)|guard]] who suspects that the Sinclairs have something to do with the mysterious disappearance of the king of [[Camelot]] and his knights. He suspects that since [[Lord Sinclair]] gave King Arthur the castle, the disappearances may be part of a bigger plot to reclaim Camelot. The guard will explain that the [[Seers' Council]] has forbidden anyone to enter Sinclair Mansion or Camelot to investigate and will so pass on the investigation to you.\n\n===Investigating===\n[[File:King's Ransom scrap paper.png|thumb|120px|Scrap paper]]\n[[File:King's Ransom address form.png|thumb|120px|Address form]]\nBreak the window on the east side of the mansion, and you shall be inside.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[File:Kings Ransom evidence.png|center]]\n|-\n!Evidence\n!Location\n|-\n|[[Scrap paper]]\n|Dining room on the ground floor.

The guard will agree that there is enough evidence to prove bad intent towards [[King Arthur]]. He says that since he has to follow proper proceedings that he will have to wait a month before presenting the evidence. You will offer to avoid the bureaucracy. He will then suggest that you learn more about the Sinclair family history, suggesting that town gossips know much about history.\n*Talk to [[Gossip]]. There are three options to ask. Ask all three to learn the Sinclair history.\n**The first two conversations are about the family history. Gossip will explain [[Lord Sinclair]] was a good friend of [[King Ulthas]] and did many good things for [[Kandarin]]. His children, however, were spoiled and horrid, but Gossip admits he didn't think they would commit murder. The second is about the mansion. He will explain that originally the Sinclair's lived in [[Camelot]] (then, under a different name). Lord Sinclair eventually sold the castle to King Arthur and his men. They packed up and built the [[Sinclair Mansion]]. His children were furious.\n**The third option is about [[Anna]]. Gossip will tell you that she is in the courthouse in [[Seers' Village]], giving a really hard time to the authorities. Gossip is positive Anna will receive a guilty verdict.\n*Head to the [[Seers' Village Courthouse|courthouse]] in Seers' Village (the building directly south of the mansion and south-east of the bank), and speak to Anna. She will say that the original murderer you suspected set her up. She will go on to explain that no one will believe her. She says the new evidence against her was forged. You will then ask her where her family has gone; she will say she doesn't know since she's been locked up. As you go to leave, she will make a deal to help you get into Camelot in exchange for help in receiving a not-guilty verdict. She will then hand you the [[criminal's thread]] that you found on the window in [[Murder Mystery]]. Anna will suggest that the servants may be able to provide testimony in her defence.\n\n('''It is possible to skip the following section and go to the trial immediately.''' Just walk down the stairs in the courthouse, and the trial will begin.) Return to the mansion, and once again, enter via the broken window. The purpose of this trip is to learn what the various servants will state during the trial.\n*Talk to the servants and ask them every possible question.\n*Two of the six servants are outside the mansion\u2014don't forget to talk to them!\n**The first question will explain what happened the night of the murder.\n**The second question will ask if they saw the person suspected in the crime.\n**The third question will ask if they saw someone handling the knife.\n**The fourth question will ask about the thread.\n**The fifth question will explain how poison was used around the house.\n*After talking to every servant (six in total), head to the Seers' Village courthouse to begin the trial.\n\n===The trial===\n[[File:King's Ransom - court in session.png|thumb|220px|right|The trial begins.]]\n*During the trial, you will call witnesses by talking to the judge, and question the witness by talking to the witness. The questions you may ask correspond to those asked while in the mansion. To get a not-guilty verdict, you must rebut the evidence provided:\n**Anna's fingerprints on the dagger\n**Anna having bought poison and not used it\n**A thread from Anna's clothing being found at the crime scene\n**Anna being at the scene of the crime\n*To successfully clear [[Anna]] of the charges, you must rebut this evidence without accidentally providing more incriminating against Anna (for example, bringing out testimony which puts Anna near Lord Sinclair's meal before he died). To do this, call the following witnesses with the following questions:\n**Call the [[Pierre|dog handler]] as a witness, and ask him about the poison.\n**Call the [[Hobbes|butler]], and ask him about the dagger.\n**Call the [[Mary|maid]], and ask her about what she saw the night of the murder.\n**Call anyone and ask about the thread to complete the case for the defence.\n*The judge will end the trial and ask for a verdict. The jury will provide a not-guilty verdict against Anna.\n\n===Back to business===\n[[File:King's Ransom statue.png|thumb|220px|Secret passage]]\n*Leave the courtroom by clicking the gate; then, talk to [[Anna]] in her cell. She will go back to being rude, but will tell you how to enter [[Camelot]].\n*Head to the east side of [[Camelot Castle]], and search the statue near the temple.\n[[File:King's Ransom confrontation.png|220px|thumb|Confronting Anna and Morgan.]]\n*You will now see a cutscene of Anna talking to [[David]]. The siblings were both responsible for Lord Sinclair's death, and set you up to trap you. They will explain they have no intention to help you. Suddenly, [[Morgan Le Faye]] will appear and knock you out with her staff.\n\n===In jail===\nAfter being knocked out by [[Morgan Le Faye]], you will wake up in a jail with Arthur's Knights and [[Merlin]].\n*Speak to Merlin. He will explain that:\n**[[King Arthur]] has been turned to a granite statue and taken away by the [[Black Knight]]s.\n**Both the Sinclairs and Morgan Le Faye have teamed up to destroy Arthur and reclaim [[Camelot]] castle.\n**The black knights have also agreed to help Morgan Le Faye and the Sinclairs.\n**Morgan Le Faye has stolen the [[Holy grail]].\n\n====Freeing Merlin====\n[[File:King's Ransom - Freeing Merlin.png|thumb|right|220px|Freeing Merlin]]\n*Ask [[Merlin]] what to do. Follow all of the available conversations.\n*Reach the vent at the top of the wall opposite the jail gate. A funny animation will show Merlin escaping with the help of all the knights making a pyramid allowing him to reach the vent.\n'''Note:''' If you happen to click on the vent again, the knights will lift you out of the cell. To continue, make your way back to Camelot and click on the gates to be teleported back into the cell by Morgan Le Faye.\n\n====Unlocking jail====\n[[File:Guard combing.png|thumb|right|220px|Guard combing]]\n*Talk to all the knights, and ask them if they have anything useful to help them escape. You will get a lot of items such as an [[air rune]], a [[law rune]], an [[empty vial]], a cooked [[shark]], a [[normal log]], a bottle of [[vodka]], etc. If you received a [[lockpick]], use it on the jail lock; otherwise, use [[Telekinetic Grab]] on the guard fixing his hair outside the cell to obtain a [[hair clip]]. Use the hair clip on the lock.\n*You will need to solve a puzzle to unlock the jail lock. The puzzle very closely resembles the popular game [[Wikipedia:Mastermind (board game)|Mastermind]].\n[[File:King's Ransom locked jaildoor puzzle.png|thumb|220px|Puzzle]]\n:*To complete this puzzle, you must set each of four tumblers to the correct height. The most foolproof way to do this (not necessarily the quickest) is to set all tumblers to the lowest height, and try the lock. If a tumbler shows a green circle, do not change that tumbler anymore. Ignore blue and red circles. For all the other tumblers, increase the height by one and try again. Continue until the lock unlocks. This method will take at most six attempts.\n*You will emerge on the ground floor of the [[Keep Le Faye]]. Arthur's knights will be engaged in battle with the [[Renegade Knight]]s.\n\n===Finding the Holy Grail===\n[[File:King's Ransom riddle.png|thumb|220px|Riddle to the Holy Grail]]\n*Head to the top floor and search on the table to the north. You will now have to solve a riddle (click on Show riddle) and choose the correct container holding the [[holy grail]]. The correct box is the round purple one on the right, second last box if counting from left to right.\n:'''Note:''' If you choose the wrong box, you will be teleported outside South-west [[Ardougne]]. To continue the quest, you will have to walk back to [[Keep Le Faye]]. When you try to open the door, [[Morgan Le Faye]] will appear and will teleport you back to jail. There, you don't need to solve the door puzzle again\u2014you just have to open the door and walk back to the top floor.\n\n===Freeing King Arthur===\n*You must now free [[King Arthur]] from his stone prison. Head to [[Wizard Cromperty]] in [[East Ardougne]]. \n*Cromperty will explain you need to free King Arthur like you did to [[Petra Fiyed]] during [[One Small Favour]], though this time, you also need to unravel [[Morgan Le Faye|Morgan]]'s spell. He will give you an [[animate rock scroll]]\u2014you will need to use on King Arthur once you have both the [[holy grail]] and some [[granite]] in your inventory.\n:'''Note:''' Even if you already have the Animate scroll, you will still need to go talk to Wizard Cromperty, or your player will not be willing to cast the spell on King Arthur.\n*To actually get to King Arthur, you will need to have a [[bronze med helm]], [[iron chainbody]], [[black platebody]], [[black platelegs]]/[[Black plateskirt|skirt]] and [[black full helmet]].\n:'''Tip:''' Get the bronze med helm and iron chainbody in [[Draynor Manor]] and at [[Wayne's Chains]] in [[Falador]] respectively if you still need them.\n*Head to the [[Black Knights' Fortress (location)|Black Knight's Fortress]] west of [[Edgeville]]/north of [[Ice Mountain]]. ([[Amulet of glory]] or [[Combat bracelet]] provide convenient teleports.)\n*Equip the helm and chain, and enter the Black Knights' Fortress through the guards' door. Then, put on your [[black equipment]], and push the wall right behind the guards' door. You cannot push the wall if you are not wearing full black armour.\n[[File:King's Ransom arthur statue.png|thumb|220px|King Arthur turned into a stone statue.]]\n*Climb down the ladder, and you will see King Arthur's statue. Use the free option.\n*Talk to King Arthur, and give him the guard uniform (bronze med helm and iron chainbody).\n*Return to [[Camelot]] and speak to King Arthur in his castle to finish the quest and receive your reward.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = King&#39;s Ransom\n|image = [[File:King&#39;s Ransom reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = *33,000 [[Defence]] experience\n*5,000 [[Magic]] experience\n*Antique [[lamp]] granting 5,000 [[experience]] to any skill level 50 or above\n*Access to the [[Knight Waves Training Grounds]]\n*The ability to use the [[Chivalry]] and [[Piety]] prayers, with level 60 and 70 [[Prayer]], respectively, after completion of [[Knight Waves Training Grounds]]\n}}\n==Music==\n*[[Knightmare]]\n*[[Lore and Order]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*When the quest was introduced in ''[[RuneScape 2]]'', the [[Party Room]] was moved from [[Seers' Village]] to [[Falador]] to make room for the [[courthouse]].\n*When finding [[Anna]] not guilty, 'Party Balloons' fall down. This is because of the Party Room being here previously, as stated by the judge when talking to him after the acquittal.\n*If you talk to [[Merlin]] after the quest, he will give you a [[hair clip]] as a memory of the adventure.\n*When in jail, one of the knights is playing with a baseball; it's a reference to the movie ''[[wikipedia:The Great Escape|The Great Escape]]'' with [[wikipedia:Steve McQueen|Steve McQueen]].\n*When the Knights of the Round Table die in battle at [[Keep Le Faye]], they simply respawn where they were killed.\n*When discussing with Merlin how to escape, your character asks if he's going to turn everyone into fish and swim out. This is a reference to the 1963 Disney animated movie ''[[wikipedia:The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone]]''.\n*King's Ransom quest is the \"newest\" quest on ''[[Old School RuneScape]]'', not counting quests exclusively released on Old School. It was the last quest released (at July 2007) before the back-up from which ''Old School RuneScape'' was built upon was taken (August 2007).\n*Despite the 65 [[Defence]] requirement not being boostable, if the quest hasn't been started and the player boosts to 65 Defence, the quest log will show the requirement as being met.\n\n{{King's Ransom}}"], "Legends' Quest": ["{{External|rs|rsc}}\n{{Has quick guide}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Legends' Quest\n|number = 50\n|image = [[File:Fighting Nezikchened.png|300px]]\n|members = Yes\n|release = 20 August [[2003]]\n|update = New - Legends Quest!\n|series = [[List of quest series#Karamja series|Karamja]], Guild\n|difficulty = Master\n|developer = Tytn H\n}}\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Talk to the guards just outside of the [[Legends' Guild]].\n|difficulty = 4\n|description = Only the elite are allowed to call themselves a Legend of ''RuneScape''.

This can no longer be done once the quest is finished! This is a slow and tedious process (~2-4 hours depending on your luck), but worth it for those who do not want to get 75 Woodcutting or hunt [[Nature impling jar|nature implings]]. Without having the level to chop down [[magic trees]], this is one of the very few ways to obtain magic logs in all of ''[[RuneScape]]''. Magic logs are needed for a few quests (16 in total): 12 for [[Desert Treasure]], 1 for [[Mourning's End Part I]], and 3 for unlocking the [[Gnome Stronghold]] [[balloon route]] (requirement for [[Monkey Madness II]]). This seems to yield magic logs about 1/4 of the time. Magic logs are also available through [[Wintertodt]] as well, and as uncommon drop from [[Revenants]], but are highly RNG based.\n\n==Walkthrough==\n===Getting started===\nTo begin the quest, talk to the [[Legends guard|guards]] just outside the [[Legends' Guild|guild]] ([[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|blr}}). If they think you're worthy, they'll send you through the gates to talk to Sir [[Radimus Erkle]] to get your assignment. What he'll do is give you an incomplete map of the [[Kharazi Jungle]], which you're to complete, as well as making friends with the inhabitants of the jungle, so they'll give you a totem pole to proudly display inside the guild.\n\nBefore you leave, take some [[papyrus]] off the table, and grab a [[machete]] from the cupboard. You can buy them from the [[Obli's General Store|general store]] in [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]] too, but these are free.\n\n===Mapping the jungle===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Radimus notes]] (He will replace at the [[Legends' Guild]] for 30gp), at least 3 [[charcoal]], at least 3 [[papyrus]], 230 [[coins]], an [[axe]] and a [[machete]].''\n\n'''''Skills required:''' 50 [[Crafting]] to map the [[jungle]].''\n:'''Note:''' You do not need 50 [[Woodcutting]] to enter the jungle. However, you do need 50 Woodcutting to cut down the Yommi Tree at the end of the quest.\n\nNow, make your way to [[Brimhaven]] by taking a boat from [[Ardougne]]. Then, you can take [[Shilo Village cart system|Hajedy's cart]] to [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]] (his fee is 200 [[coins]]). You can also use [[fairy ring]] (code {{Fairycode|ckr}}), north-west of Shilo Village.\n[[File:Kharazi cutting.png|thumb|220px|The jungle is very dense.]]\nMake sure to buy some charcoal and at least three sheets of papyrus from the [[Obli's General Store|general store]] before you leave Shilo; then, head out the gate and towards the south. To get into the Kharazi Jungle, you'll need to cut your way through the overgrown jungle vegetation using a hatchet and machete.\n\nOnce inside (preferably on the eastern/western sides, so you don't have to run back and forth), start mapping down the jungle with your charcoal and papyrus by right-clicking on the Radimus notes and then selecting 'Complete'. Sometimes the charcoal and/or papyrus can break, so you should bring extra just in case. Alternatively, you may mess up the papyrus, but be able to salvage it. You should watch out for the [[jungle wolf|jungle wolves]], as they are aggressive; the [[jungle savage]]s and oomlie birds aren't aggressive unless provoked (see below).\n\n:'''Note:''' If you intend on freeing [[Sir Amik Varze]] in [[Recipe for Disaster]], you should grab [[Vanilla pod|vanilla pod(s)]] whilst you are here\u2014they are located directly south-west from the water pool near the beach in a group of five plants.\n\n====Tips====\n* Shake a [[leafy palm tree]] to acquire a [[palm leaf]], and drop it and pick it up five times to complete a hard task for the [[Karamja Diary]].\n* Additionally, kill an [[oomlie bird]], wrap its [[Raw oomlie|meat]] in the palm leaf, cook it over [[fire]], and eat the [[oomlie wrap]] to complete another hard task while you're here. The oomlie wrap can be cooked elsewhere and consumed to earn the hard task. You do not have to cook and eat it in the jungle.\n* Chop some [[Teak tree|teak]] and [[mahogany tree]]s at the southern coastal end of the jungle to complete two medium tasks rather than paying 100 [[trading sticks]] to enter the [[Hardwood Grove]].\n\n===Contacting the locals===\n'''''Skills required:''' 50 [[Agility]]''\n\nHead back out of the [[jungle]], and talk to one of the [[jungle forester]]s, who are wandering around right at the edge of the jungle. They have a [[bull roarer]], which they'll be willing to give up if you give them a copy of your notes. Use the completed Radimus notes on the forester, who will then make a copy before giving you their bull roarer.\n:'''<span style=\"color:red\">Warning:</span>''' Do not use the bull roarer around [[jungle savage]]s or oomlie birds, or you'll be attacked!\n[[File:Totem Locations OSRS.png|thumb|340x340px|'Totem Pole' Locations in Jungle.]]\nGo inside the jungle again, and swing it near the totem pole found east of the water pool represented by a blue square on the map to call a local named [[Gujuo]] out of hiding. '''(There are multiple totem poles in the jungle, so if nothing happens, try another one.)''' He'll ask for your help, since his tribe's shaman, [[Ungadulu]], is trapped in his [[Viyeldi caves|cave]].\n[[File:Viyeldi caves location.png|thumb|left|200px|The location of the cave.]]\n[[File:Viyeldi caves entrance.png|thumb|220px|The entrance to the cave.]]\nFrom now on, you can call Gujuo using the bull roarer from anywhere in the jungle. Towards the northwestern edge of the jungle, you'll find some rocks that you can squeeze through to get into the cave.\n\nInvestigate (right-click) the fire wall and talk to [[Ungadulu]], who warns you not to approach the flames, but becomes possessed and informs you that only pure water can extinguish the flames. Next, search the various items, namely the bed, table and crate, in the cave to obtain Ungadulu's notes: a [[scrawled note]] from the crate; [[a scribbled note]] on the table; and a [[scrumpled note]] on the bed. Reading them tells you how the shaman had prepared to summon his ancestors and pay homage to them, but fell prey to an evil presence in the cave.\n\nOnce you're back outside again, call [[Gujuo]] with your [[bull roarer]] to get a bit more information. Go back down, and investigate the flames to Ungadulu again, who reveals that you need pure water. Go back up, and call Gujuo. Tell him you need some pure water to douse some magic flames (option 4). Ask, \"What kind of a vessel?\" (option 5). He'll give you a [[sketch]] of the vessel. '''You must search for Ungadulu's notes in the cave before you can obtain the sketch!'''\n\n====Pure water====\n'''''Items required:''' ''[[Radimus notes]], an [[axe]], a [[machete]], a ''[[hammer]], a [[prayer potion]] (if you fail to bless the bowl and your prayer drops below 42), 2-6 [[gold bar]]s (6 to be safe, more if you want more golden bowls; highly advisable if intending to get [[magic logs]] from yommi trees later), and the [[bull roarer]].''\n\n'''''Skills required:''' 50 [[Smithing]] to create the [[gold bowl]] and 42 [[Prayer]] to bless the bowl (if boosting Prayer, make sure to use your [[ancient mace]] special attack on a [[PoH]] [[max hit dummy]] before this).''\n\nReturn to [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]] and bank. Get out a [[hammer]] and at least two [[gold bar]]s. Go to any [[anvil]] (the closest is in [[Tai Bwo Wannai Village]]) and try to make the [[gold bowl]]. You may fail, so to be safe, bring more than two bars.\n\n'''Note: '''If you can use fairy rings, you can save time running by using the minigame teleport to [[Blast Furnace]] for an anvil then take a mine cart back to the [[Grand Exchange]], then use the fairy ring there to return to the jungle. The anvil in the Blast Furnace area requires 60 smithing.\n\nHead back into the jungle and call [[Gujuo]]. He'll help you bless your gold bowl so that it can carry the pure water. Your [[prayer points]] must be ''at or above'' 42 to attempt this, and if you fail, it will drain 5 prayer points. If it drains your prayer below 42, you'll have to restore it to try again.\n\n'''Bank to get the required items for the next section before continuing.''' With your [[blessed golden bowl]], head to the pool of pure water towards the middle of the jungle. Since you can't quite reach the water, cut some reeds from the edge of the pool with your [[machete]] (using your machete on the reeds), and use [[Hollow reed|them]] to siphon the water out into your bowl (using your hollow reed on the water pool). Note, however, if you leave the jungle, the water will evaporate, requiring you to refill the bowl again when you return.\n\n===Exploring the shaman's cave===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Radimus notes]], [[bull roarer]], an [[axe]], a [[pickaxe]], a [[machete]], 1-2 [[lockpick]]s (2 to be safe), 1 [[soul rune]], 1 [[earth rune]], 1 [[mind rune]], 2 [[law runes]], [[blessed gold bowl]], cut [[sapphire]], [[emerald]], [[ruby]], [[diamond]], [[red topaz]], [[jade]] and [[opal]].''\n\n'''''Recommended'': '''''A [[Super restore|super restore potion]] if your level is not far above the required level stated below.''\n\n'''''Skills required:''' 50 [[Agility]] to squeeze through the crevice, 50 [[Thieving]] to pick the locked door, 52 [[Mining]] to smash the boulders and 50 [[Strength]] to force the heavy door.''\n[[File:Viyeldi caves map.png|thumb|200px|A map of the cave.]]\n'''Bank to get the required items if you haven't yet. Do not extinguish the flames with the water yet.''' Once you have the items, go back to the cave and squeeze through a crevice hidden behind the easternmost bookshelf. As you proceed further into the cave, you will come across an ancient gate. This is where your [[lockpick]] comes to play. Attempt to pick the lock; if you fail, you'll lose your lockpick. However, as there is a message before the lockpick fails, you can easily circumvent it by clicking elsewhere, which will save your lockpick.\n\nOnce past this door, you'll need a [[pickaxe]] to mine three boulders out of the way. If you fail, your [[Mining]] level will decrease by 1. Once past these three boulders, use brute force to open the next set of doors; failing this will result in your [[Strength]] being lowered.\n\nBe careful once through, as there are a number of level 83 [[Death Wing]]s on the other side. You should kill one while you are here, as it is a hard task in the [[Karamja Diary]].\n\nRun farther into the cave, and jump over the jagged wall. When you get further inside, you'll find a place where there's markings on the wall, telling you to use the ''SMELL'' runes to get through. [[Soul rune|Soul]], [[Mind rune|Mind]], [[Earth rune|Earth]], [[Law rune|Law]], [[Law rune|Law]]. Make sure to put them in in order, and you'll be let through.\n[[File:Getting Binding Book.png|thumb|220px|Retrieving the binding book]]\nInside, you'll face your next puzzle, where you'll see a number of stalagmites sitting in pools of water. Fit your [[gems]] into each one by trying to place them in until you get it right. When all of them are in, there will be a little light show, and the [[binding book]] will appear. One useful feature of this book is that you can bless [[vials]] and fill them with pure water from your bowl to make [[holy water]]. Wielding these while fighting [[demons]] damages them. Head back out of the cave.\n\n'''<span style=\"color:red\">Warning: Do not try to take the gem after you place it on the stalagmites otherwise it will be gone and you have to run back to bank/buy the new one.</span>'''\n\n'''Note:''' If you lose the binding book, you must repeat the steps above in order to reclaim it! However, the \"SMELL\" runes are not needed a second time.\n\n===Fighting the demon===\nThere is an upcoming fight, so be prepared. If you want, you can go back to the bank and resupply. If you choose to leave the jungle in order to return to the bank, your pure water will evaporate, and you will need to refill your [[blessed gold bowl]] in order to continue.\n[[File:Fighting Nezikchened.png|thumb|220px|Nezikchened, the demon possessing Ungadulu.]]\nEither way, when you're ready, use your pure water on the fire wall to step through without damage. Then, use your [[book of binding]] on [[Ungadulu]] to release the demon, [[Nezikchened]].\n\nHe is level 187 and will drain your [[prayer]] at the beginning of the battle, but never again after that, so be careful if you want to use it while fighting him. Additionally, he'll cast a [[Fire Blast]] just before dying, so make sure to keep your [[HP]] up so that he doesn't kill you with his last ditch attack. '''This Fire Blast will hit through the [[Protect from Magic]] prayer.'''\n\nYou can lower his stats if you use [[Silverlight]] or [[Darklight]] on stab mode ([[Melee]]) or throw [[holy water]] vials at him ([[Ranged]]). Be sure though to bring a better classed secondary weapon. The desk can be used as a [[safespot]], resulting in Nezikchened switching to [[Magic]] attacks.\n\nOnce he's defeated, Ungadulu will thank you and give you some [[yommi tree seeds]]. '''Be careful not to attack him as this will knock you out of the octogram and deal some damage, and if your health is low after the fight, this may kill you. Use the [[drop trick]] to get more just in case later if you lose the plants to rotting or if you are an [[Ironman]] and want to get [[magic logs]].''' Ask him how to get out, he'll cast a spell to let you walk through the flames.\n:'''Note:''' There seems to be a glitch where if there is more than one person in the room (not inside the octagram), Nezikchened may go [[aggressive]] on the other player. This then makes Nezikchened completely harmless and unable to attack the player.\n\n===Replenishing the pure water===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Ardrigal]], [[snake weed]] and a [[vial of water]] to make the [[bravery potion]], [[yommi tree seeds]], [[Radimus notes]], a [[machete]], an [[axe]], 1-2 [[lockpick]]s, a [[pickaxe]], [[bull roarer]], [[golden bowl]], [[rope]], [[unpowered orb]], [[runes]]/[[staff]] to cast any [[Charge Orb]] spell once (on normal spellbook).

Then, use it on the ''[[yommi tree seeds]]'' to germinate them. After germinating the seeds, attempt to refill your bowl again\u2014only this time you discover the pool is dry.\n\nCall [[Gujuo]], and he'll tell you that the underground source has probably been blocked off. You find out that you'll need a potion of courage to be able to make it through the dark tunnel.\n[[File:Jungle Potion materials map.png|thumb|200px|Locations of the Snake weed and Ardrigal, highlighted in green and orange.]]\nTo make the potion you need [[Ardrigal]] and [[Snake weed]], which you found once already through the [[Jungle Potion]] quest. If taking [[Legends' Quest#The long path|the long path]] later in the quest, get two of each, as you will need to make two bravery potions. Mix the snake weed into a vial of water '''first''' to make a [[Snake weed mixture]], '''then''' add the ardrigal to produce a single-dose [[bravery potion]]. '''Don't drink the bravery potion yet.'''\n\nGo back to [[Ungadulu's cave]] and head down into the cave again, going through all the same areas that you did before. This time, though, when you reach the area with the seven pools, head further to where another door is. Cast any [[Charge Orb]] spell on it to go through.\n\nYou'll find yourself in a room with several barrels in it. You can smash them to reveal things like [[food]], [[rope]], [[weapons]], or sometimes enemies. For now though, ignore them.\n\nUse your rope on the winch and '''drink your bravery potion ''before''''' heading down into the depths. If you've brought along a [[Salve amulet]], now is the time to equip it. If the rope disappears, just search the winch again so it reappears and then go down.\n\nYou'll be on the top of a long, winding path with several rocks covering it. Climb over these rocks to the bottom of the path, but be warned. If you fall off, you can take extremely heavy damage (40+), depending on where you fell. You may also be immediately attacked by one of the three warriors mentioned below.\n\nOnce at the bottom, you'll see three different '''undead''' warriors named [[Ranalph Devere]] (level 92), [[Irvig Senay]] (level 100), and [[San Tojalon]] (level 106), who will drop the [[lump of crystal|lump]], [[hunk of crystal|hunk]], and [[chunk of crystal]], respectively. Talk to them and fight them individually. Once you've defeated them, they won't attack again. Take the crystals over to the furnace to the north-east, and put them in to make a glowing [[heart crystal]].\n\nThere are multiple of each warrior in the room. If you are using [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] hiding behind one of the empty ore rocks allows you to [[safespot]] them.\n\nNow, look at the [[minimap]]. If you haven't noticed already, the area looks like the head of a dragon.\n[[File:Viyeldi caves mossy rock.png|thumb|220px|The mossy rock that players must use the heart crystal on to activate it.]]\nGo to where the eye is, and use the crystal on a mossy rock there. It will glow. Go to the south to find a shimmering field, which the crystal will now open when you put it in a heart-shaped recess next to it. On the other side of the barrier are three [[lesser demon]]s, and past them, is the source of the pure water.\n\n===The second battle===\n[[File:Legends' Quest Echned Zekin appears.png|thumb|220px|Echned Zekin, the ancient spirit.]]\nYou'll notice that there is a boulder blocking the water flow. Try to push it, and a spirit named Echned Zekin (which is an anagram of [[Nezikchened]]) will appear. He'll say he's being tortured and beg you to help him by killing the spirit, [[Viyeldi]]. He'll give you a [[dark dagger]] to do so.\n\nIf you have no intentions of killing Viyeldi, you still have to accept the dagger from Echned, as the dagger must be given to [[Ungadulu]] in order to proceed with the quest.\n\nThere are now two paths to choose from.\n\n'''Players who leave during the fights will need another [[Charge Orb]] spell to get through the door again.'''\n\n====The short path====\nDo as the spirit asks. Go back to the staircase, and jump back up to the very top (it could take a while).\n\nYou may have noticed a [[blue hat (Legends' Quest)|blue wizard hat]] on the way in\u2014maybe even tried to pick it up. If you did, you met a spirit named [[Viyeldi]], who [[Echned]] wanted you to kill. Stab him with the [[Dark dagger|dagger]]; then, go back to the boulder.\n\nBefore pushing the boulder, proceed to the southern boulder if you wish to [[safespot]] [[Nezikchened]]. Tell Echned Zekin that you did as he asked\u2014you cannot have a second dark dagger in your inventory when talking to him or else he won't think you've done the task. Nezikchened will reveal himself and attack the player, draining the player's [[Prayer]].\n\nAfter the battle, push the boulder out of the way of the water's flow. Fill your [[golden bowl]] if you haven't already germinated the seeds.\n\n====The long path====\n:''Skip the \"long path\" if you did the short path.''\n\nDo not try to pick up the [[Blue hat (Legends' Quest)|blue hat]] or talk to [[Viyeldi]]. Talk to [[Ungadulu]] instead, his magic will allow you to pass through the fire wall safely.\n\nUse the [[Dark dagger|dagger]] on him. He will recognise the evil in the dagger and take it from you, giving you a [[Holy Force]] spell card, which severely weakens demons. Now, head back down to the bottom once again.\n\nUnfortunately, you'll have to use another [[unpowered orb]] and another [[Charge Orb]] spell to get back in. Still, being back on the surface does give you a chance to restock on supplies for the next fight.\n\nEither way, when you get back to the bottom and push the boulder out of the way, you'll have to fight the [[Nezikchened|demon]] again. To start the fight, cast the Holy Force spell when the spirit is near you. At the start of the battle, your Prayer will be halved, and you should use the holy force spell to weaken him. He fights with a very ineffective [[magic]] attack at the beginning of the battle, and he'll soon realise that it doesn't work and will switch to [[melee]]. Defeat him however you like, and then push the boulder out of the way of the water's flow.\n:'''Note:''' If you don't kill [[Nezikchened]] fast enough, he will reset, causing you to have to push the boulder again to talk to him. The combat will reset, and he will have full [[health]] as well as drain your [[prayer]] again.\n\n===Restoring the totem===\n[[File:Yommi_tree_growth_stages.gif|thumb|Planting and growing the yommi.]]\n'''''Skills required:''' 45 [[Herblore]] to plant the yommi tree, 50 [[Woodcutting]] to create the [[yommi totem]].''\n\n'''Note for Ironmen: Do not make the [[Yommi totem|totem]] until you have all the [[magic logs]] you need!''' (If you stop receiving logs at some point (6+ trees with no logs), leave the [[Kharazi Jungle]] and come back. Based on anecdotal evidence, standing directly adjacent to the trunk of the tree seems to give logs more often. Allowing a [[yommi tree]] to die and then chopping it down has a chance (seemingly 1 in 4) to yield magic logs, rarely multiple sets. At the minimum [[Herblore]] requirement to plant the tree, about 192 seeds should be enough to get 16 magic logs accounting for a high (66%) failure rate from planting the seeds. When a dead tree is chopped down, the soil is damaged, so the player will have to hop worlds or move to another spot.)\n\nTeleport or climb your way back out of the [[Viyeldi caves|cave]] and head to [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]] or teleport out to bank. Grab the [[Radimus notes]], [[bull roarer]], an [[axe]] ([[Rune axe|rune]] or higher required to cut the yommi tree), a [[machete]], [[yommi seeds]], [[golden bowl]], and any [[potions]] or [[food]] you need for the most difficult battle of this quest.\n\nFill up your bowl from the restored pond and find a fertile patch of soil. It will be bare of vegetation and brown on the map. Use your water on the seeds to germinate them; then, use the bull roarer to call [[Gujuo]] for instructions on what to do next. Fill the bowl again, and plant the germinated seeds in the fertile soil and wait for it to grow. '''If it says you planted the seeds incorrectly, try logging out and back in.'''\n[[File:Chopping yommi tree.png|thumb|220px|A player creating the yommi totem.]]\nOnce it reaches the second stage, fill your bowl again, and use it on the tree. The third and final stage is the '''adult''' yommi tree. Keep alert, because once it has reached this stage, you'll have only a brief window of time where you can cut it, or it will go rotten, and you will need to start again. Use your axe on it, and keep doing this until you've chopped all the branches off and shaped it into a [[yommi totem]]. You'll know it's done when you can pick it up.\n\nIf you lose all your seeds, you can always go back and get more from [[Ungadulu]] in the cave. Do remember to germinate them with the sacred water.\n\n===The final battle===\nNow, find any of the locations where there's an old, brown totem. One is located just east of the pool, but there are others all over the forest. Once you find one, make all the preparations you need to fight\u2014turn on [[Protect from Melee]] and use your new totem on the old one.\n[[File:Legends' Quest Nezikchened final fight.png|thumb|220px|Nezikchened returns to destroy the hero once and for all.]]\nWhen the [[Nezikchened|demon]] spawns, he will say his dialogue and begin attacking you! You are immobile while he is speaking and can take heavy damage, so '''it is HIGHLY recommended to turn on Protect from Melee before replacing the totem to be safe'''.\n\nIf you chose the '''short path''', you will need to kill the three undead warriors you saw down in the [[Viyeldi caves|dragon cave]] once again. He will summon them one at a time, going from the strongest to weakest in terms of combat level. After each hero is killed, make sure that Protect from Melee is up as the interlude repeats, and [[Nezikchened]] will freely hit you four times on three occasions, which can deal a lot of damage if he gets lucky with his hits.\n\nIf you took the '''long path''', Nezikchened will not summon the undead heroes due to being weakened by the [[holy force]] spell, but be cautious as he will hit four times before the fight.\n\nOnce again, you will have to fight the demon, and once again he'll drain your [[prayer]], so be ready for it. He attacks with [[Melee]] and [[Magic]], which is much more effective this time. He doesn't use Magic that much if you melee him. Using [[Ranged]], Magic, or a [[halberd]] from between the trees with [[Protect from Magic]] on will allow you to defeat him without losing [[health]].\n:'''<span style=\"color:red\">Warning:</span>''' If you take too long to fight him, he will disappear. When you resummon him, he returns with full health.\n\n===Finishing up===\nWhen [[Nezikchened]] dies, replace the totem, and [[Gujuo]] will appear to thank you for defeating the demon. He'll give you a totem pole as a reward for everything you've done.\n\nReturn to [[Radimus Erkle]] with the [[Radimus notes]] and [[gilded totem]] ([[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|blr}}), who will then let you into the guild. He will train you in one of 12 various skills of your choice up to four times. After all the experience rewards are claimed, the quest is complete.\n\n'''Congratulations!

A group of adventurers have set up camp in [[Lumbridge Swamp]], claiming to be searching for the mystical lost city. You must find the truth of this claim, and gain entrance to the moon of [[Gielinor]], Zanaris.\n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|description=Can you find the legendary lost city of [[Zanaris]]?\n|start=Go to [[Lumbridge Swamp]].

Go to the northwest corner of the swamp to find a [[Warrior (Lost City)|Warrior]], an [[Archer (Lost City)|Archer]], a [[Wizard (Lost City)|Wizard]], and a [[Monk (Lost City)|Monk]] standing around a camp-fire. Talk to the warrior, and ask him, ''\"What are you camped out here for?\"'' He will let it slip that he is searching for [[Zanaris]]. Ask him, ''\"Who's Zanaris?\"'', and then, ''\"If it's hidden, how are you planning to find it?\"'' Lastly, say, ''\"Looks like you don't know either,\"'' and in his anger, he will accidentally reveal that there is a leprechaun hiding in a nearby tree who knows how to get to Zanaris.\n[[File:Lost City - Chop Tree.png|thumb|220x220px|\"Chop\", instead of \"Chop down.\"]]\nHead a little bit west, and look for a tree that strangely only has a \"Chop\" option instead of a \"Chop-down\" option. Click on the tree, and a leprechaun named [[Shamus]] will pop out. Ask him how to get to Zanaris, and he will tell you that you need a [[Dramen staff]]. To get this, you will need to chop down a tree inside of the\u00a0[[Entrana Dungeon]].\n\n===The island of Entrana===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[knife]], combat [[runes]], and [[food]] (both optional but highly recommended)''\n\nUnfortunately, you're not allowed to take [[armour]] or [[weapons]] to [[Entrana]], but you can take:\n* Items to make better armour, such as a [[needle]], [[thread]], and [[dragonhide]] or [[leather]]\n* Some clothing options, such as H.A.M Robes and Full Graceful\n* A [[knife]] and [[logs]] (or unstrung [[bow]]), and a [[bow string]] so you can make a bow.\n* [[Arrows]]\n* [[Runes]] (for [[combat]] and [[teleport]]ing)\n* [[Potions]]\n* [[Food]]\n* [[Jewellery]]\n* [[God book]]s\n\nMake your way to [[Port Sarim]]. On the north east dock, there are monks of Entrana, and a [[bank deposit box]]. Store your axe in the bank deposit box and take the boat to Entrana. When you get off the boat, go to the east through the temple; then north over the bridge; then west. You will find a monk next to a dungeon entrance. Climb down.\n\n'''Note:''' when you enter the dungeon, your prayer will be reduced to nearly 0. If you aren't safespotting, it's suggested that you bring at least one prayer potion to counteract the effect.\n\nOnce in the dungeon, you will have to kill [[zombie (common)|zombies]] (level 25) until one of them drops a [[bronze axe]]. There is a safespot by the mushrooms against the west wall, and another by the little group of mushrooms in southern part of the zombie area. If using the [[Crumble Undead]] spell to fight zombies, make sure to save runes for some 20-30 casts for use against the [[Tree spirit (Lost City)|tree spirit]] later. Once you have obtained an axe from the zombies, travel around the cave until you see some [[greater demon]]s and a small cave off to the south. (NOTE: ''do not'' go through the magical door to the east, it takes you to level 32 [[Wilderness]]). Run past the demons into this cave, and use your axe to chop the [[Dramen Tree]] found inside.\n\nA level 101 [[Tree spirit (Lost City)|tree spirit]] will appear. An easy way to safespot this fight is to run all the way to the north (with the tree spirit in tow) and then all the way to the south behind the mushrooms. Bring plenty of arrows for [[Ranged|Range]]: more than 200 if around level 25 Ranged. You'll need to bring the materials to fletch your own bow and craft your own armour. It is possible to attempt to melee the tree spirit, but it hits hard (11's) and absorbs most melee attacks. A smarter way to take on the spirit is to buy [[runes]] from the rune store in Port Sarim, hide behind the fungi to the south of the tree, and use magic. [[Crumble Undead]] is extremely effective: Even at the level at which it is first unlocked, the spell can dispose of the tree spirit in as few as 10 casts.\nIt is not possible to have someone else weaken the tree spirit. You must kill it entirely on your own. [[File:Lost City - Tree spirit safe spot.png|thumb|290px|A safe spot for ranging or casting magic on the Tree Spirit.]]\n\n[[File:Lost City - Zanaris entrance.png|thumb|Entrance to Zanaris.]]\nOnce you've defeated the tree spirit, cut the tree again to get a [[Dramen branch]].\n\n'''Note:''' If you plan on doing [[The Fremennik Trials]] later, it would be wise to get another dramen branch, but do not make it into a staff so that you can smuggle it in [[Thorvald]]'s trial. Also, another branch is required for freeing [[Freeing Sir Amik Varze|Sir Amik Varze in Recipe for Disaster]], thus two branches excluding the one in this quest.\n\nUse a [[knife]] with the [[Dramen branch]] to get a [[Dramen staff]].\n\n'''CAUTION:''' if you decide to go through the magical door, you will be teleported into level 32 [[Wilderness]].\n\n===Finishing up===\n'''''Items required: '''[[Dramen staff]]''\n\nTeleport out, and make your way back to the [[Lumbridge Swamp]].

Find [[Meteora]] in the village; she is on the southwestern side of the village by the wall. She will tell you that although they don't have a leader, the [[Oneiromancer]] will be able to help you more than anyone. Walk to the southeastern part of the island, and find the Oneiromancer (near the [[Astral altar]]), who tells you that you will need three things (which must be done in the following sequence).\n\n====Waking sleep potion====\n'''''Items needed for this part of the quest: '''[[Guam leaf]], [[marrentill]], [[pestle and mortar]], and a [[suqah tooth]].''\n\nTalk to [[Baba Yaga]] in the chicken house in the village (north of the bank in the fenced area \u2014 it walks like a chicken). She will give you a special potion bottle, and tell you that you need a [[guam leaf]], [[marrentill]] and a crushed [[Suqah tooth]].\n\nFirst, fill the [[empty vial]] with water; then travel to the south-east again, and kill a [[Suqah]] (level 111). The tooth does not drop every time, but it's fairly common. '''Make sure to also pick up [[Suqah hide|their hides]], as you will need four (4) of them later on.''' (Note that you do not need to get '''all''' four hides now, as you will be killing more [[Suqah]] to obtain the [[Lunar amulet|amulet]] later.) They also drop guam and marrentill herbs. Once you have a tooth, add the guam leaf and marrentill to the vial, and then crush the Suqah tooth with the [[pestle and mortar]] to get a [[ground tooth]]. Add the ground tooth to the vial and then talk to the [[Oneiromancer]] again to give her the potion.\n[[File:Enchanting dramen staff.gif|thumb|220px|A player enchanting the [[Dramen staff]].]]\n\n====Lunar staff====\n'''''Items needed for this part of the quest:''' [[Dramen staff]] (that you are willing to lose), ([[Air talisman|air]], [[Fire talisman|fire]], [[Water talisman|water]], and [[earth talisman]]) or ([[Air tiara|air]], [[Fire tiara|fire]], [[Water tiara|water]], and [[earth tiara]]) or ([[elemental talisman]]) or (access to the [[Abyss]]).''\n\n'''Talk to the [[Oneiromancer]] to give her the potion before starting the staff.''' You won't be able to make lunar staves after this next part (and must pay 30,000 coins for more), so it is advisable to make more than one. Take your [[dramen staff]] (or staves) to all four elemental altars in this order: [[Air altar|Air]], [[Fire altar|Fire]], [[Water altar|Water]] and [[Earth altar|Earth]]. Once there, 'use' the staff on each of the four altars.\n\nThe [[lunar staff]] or staves you create will change names depending on which step you are currently on in enchanting it. Only enchanting it with the air element labels the staff 'Lunar staff pt 1', with air and fire 'Lunar staff pt 2' and so on and so forth.\n\nAfter the fourth enchantment of earth, it becomes a lunar staff that you are unable to equip until you are able to wear clothes of the [[Moon Clan]]. Worse yet, the Oneiromancer will temporarily take it from you until later on. (If using [[fairy rings]] to transport yourself, bring one regular dramen staff with you to use for fairy rings. However, once you give a lunar staff to the Oneiromancer, any extra you made will become equipable AND can be used to access fairy rings). Take the staff to the Oneiromancer.\n\n====Ceremonial clothes====\n'''''Items needed for this part of the quest:''' 400 [[coins]], a [[pickaxe]], [[hammer]], a [[needle]], 2 [[thread]], 4 [[suqah hide]], [[Seal of passage]],\u00a0and a [[spade]].''[[File:Mining stalagmite.png|thumb|220px|Mining the stalagmite for the [[Lunar helm|helm]].]]\nThese consist of eight different items:\n*[[Lunar helm|Helm]] - Take your [[pickaxe]] and [[hammer]], and travel to the north-east of the island, and you should find a [[Lunar Isle mine|dungeon.]] You must run past some [[Suqah]], which may cast [[Ice Barrage]], to reach it. Once inside, mine any stalagmite to get some [[lunar ore]]. You can only mine one, but one is all you need for the helmet. There is a furnace and anvil in [[Rellekka]] where you can [[Smithing|smith]] the helm. You can return to Rellekka quickly by destroying the [[Seal of passage]], and speaking to any of the lunar citizens. (Remember to speak to [[Brundt]] for another seal, before you return to the island.)\n*[[Lunar cape|Cape]] - Talk to [[Pauline Polaris]] to the northwestern side of the village. You have to guess her name; first guess ''Pauline''\u00a0and then after receiving a clue, choose ''Jane Blud-Hagic-Maid.''\n*[[Lunar amulet|Amulet]] - Talk to [[Meteora]] in south part of the village. She'll tell you that she'll swap her amulet for her [[A special tiara|tiara]] that she lost to one of the Suqah. Kill Suqah to get it back (it can take five or more Suqah kills to get the tiara) and '''keep the hides''' until you have four (you will need them for the next step), and then exchange the tiara for the amulet.\n*[[Lunar torso|Torso]], [[Lunar gloves|Gloves]], [[Lunar boots|Boots]] and [[Lunar legs|Legs]] - Speak to [[Rimae Sirsalis]] at the clothes shop; she will tell you that she can tan the [[Suqah hide]]s for 400 coins. Collect four Suqah hides if you haven't already, get them tanned, and with some [[thread]], use a [[needle]] on the [[Suqah leather]] to make the four items. (She sells needles and thread.)\n[[File:Lunar ring location.png|thumb|300px|[[Lunar ring]] location]]\n*[[Lunar ring|Ring]] - Speak to [[Selene]] near the center of the village; she will give you a riddle. Take a [[spade]], and travel round outside the southern side of the village to the west until you come to a bridge. Dig on the blue flowers to the very south-west of the island, as shown in the picture. Make sure you complete the dialogue or else you will not receive the ring.\nTake all items back to the [[Oneiromancer]], and she will give you all your obtained items back (make sure you have 11 free inventory spots), plus some [[kindling]] that was obtained from the first '''''ever''''' [[magic tree]].\n:'''Important:''' Do not take any \"combat items\" with you (shields, potions, weapons) aside from an axe you are willing to lose.\n\nReturn to the village and from the bank grab '''[[runes]] to cast [[Combat spells]] on the boss,''' some [[food]] and possibly [[Agility]] boosts (e.g. [[Agility potion]]), [[tinderbox]], and if you wish, an [[axe]] of any type (but not necessary because one is obtainable later). Make sure you '''don't bank the [[seal of passage]]''' or you will have to go get it from another bank before you can continue the quest. '''Equip all of the lunar items that you acquired, including the lunar staff'''; if not, when you use the kindling on the brazier, it will not work and you have to get another kindling and take another [[waking sleep vial]] from the Oneiromancer. It is recommended to use the kindling on the potion, drop the [[soaked kindling]], and talk to the Oneiromancer again to obtain an potion and kindling in case of a disconnect.\n\nEnter a long building on the western side of the village that has a ceremonial brazier and a staircase inside. '''You cannot change your equipment within the [[Dream World]], so it is recommended to bring [[runes]] to cast [[Combat spells]] on the boss.''' Use your waking sleep vial on your kindling, light the brazier with your tinderbox, and use the kindling on the brazier.\n:'''Note:''' If you logout while in the Dreamland, you will have to go get another set of potion kindling from the Oneiromancer. (Your progress in the Dreamland will be saved.)\n\n===Part 3 - Dream World===\n[[File:Entering Dreamworld.gif|thumb|220px|A player entering the [[Dream World]].]]\nYou are now in the [[Dream World]]. Talk to the [[Ethereal Man]] or [[Ethereal Lady]] at the centre of the Dreamworld, and he or she will tell you that you need to face six puzzles. At the edges of Dreamland are stone portal-like things; step into them to attempt each puzzle. After completing each puzzle, talk to the man or lady in the centre again to discuss what the challenge has taught you.\n[[File:Fluke challenge.png|thumb|220px]]\n'''1.

The goal is to be the first one to stack 20 logs in the center on the \"Deposit Log pile\".

Say that you are, and you get to face \"[[Me]]\", a level 79 opponent who's pretty easy and is geared to your [[stats]].

He will tell you that an important visitor, [[Wolfbone]], has arrived, and that they require your help. Agree to help them.\n\nWolfbone comes from a place named [[Weiss]], a troll town far north of the Stronghold, and wanted to meet with the [[mountain trolls]] to trade. Their leader, [[Mother]], wants the mountain trolls to send an ambassador up to Weiss to teach their inventions while Wolfbone teaches theirs in the Stronghold. Burntmeat will tell you that they have chosen [[My Arm]] to be the ambassador for the mountain trolls, as he has travelled to distant lands (with you) before. Wolfbone will then show you the way to their town by sea, as climbing the mountains is too difficult.\n\nTake the stairs near Burntmeat, and climb the ladder north-west past [[Kob]]. You will see My Arm training [[Drunken Dwarf's Leg]] to take over his role as the herb patch caretaker. Talk to My Arm, and you will ask him to meet you by Larry's boat north-east of [[Rellekka]].\n\nHead to Larry's boat. The quickest way to reach there is using the [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|DKS}}, and then running west. Talk to [[Larry]] and ask him if you could borrow his boat. A short cutscene will play, showing My Arm's arrival. Speak to Larry again, and you and My Arm will sail to Weiss.\n\n===Troll Diplomacy===\n''Items required: Any [[pickaxe]] and [[rope]] (both obtainable during this part).''<br />\n''Items recommended: [[Weight-reducing clothing]] and [[stamina potion]]s, a teleport to [[Draynor Village]].''\n\nAfter some time, you and [[My Arm]] will arrive just north of [[Weiss]]. As My Arm cannot climb the rockslide to reach Weiss, you must find a way to help him. Search the wrecked boat and obtain a [[rope]] and [[bronze pickaxe]].\n[[File:Making Friends with My Arm - climbing rockslide.png|thumb|250px|Climbing up the cliff to reach Weiss.]]\nAttempt to mine the cave entrace. After some dialogue, climb up the rockslides nearby (requiring 68 [[Agility]], [[boosts]] usable), and use a rope on the tree. Next, climb the rope and cross the ledge. Lastly, climb the next rockslide and pass the fallen tree.\n\nOnce you've reached the top, speak to [[Boulder]]. He will not let you in, as Weiss is a troll town and humans are unwelcome. Instead, go east of him and sneak in through the gap in the fence. You will enter an [[instanced]] version of the city with trolls throwing rocks at you, which will knock you out of the city if they hit you.\n\n{{Listen\n|title = Kicked out of Weiss\n|align = right\n|filename = Kicked out of Weiss.ogg\n|desc = The track that plays upon getting knocked out.}}\nGo south along the city's edge, then west. Once you reach a small alleyway, recover your [[run energy]] if necessary. Run along the western wall and zigzag to the east, while running north, until you reach the previously spotted hole in the ground to enter the mine. Once inside, '''DO NOT''' try to use the ramp. Quickly, go south through the narrow gap near the body of water. This gap acts as a checkpoint should you be knocked out again.\n[[File:Making Friends with My Arm - swimming in Weiss cave.png|thumb|250px|Swimming through the Weiss cave, evading trolls in the process.]]\nFollow the path and swim through the water, again avoiding the thrown rocks. At the end will be the mine entrance that needs to be unblocked for My Arm to enter (requiring 72 [[Mining]], [[boosts]] usable). However, before he can enter, a small path of stepping stones needs to be created in the water for My Arm to walk on, done by letting the trolls above throw rocks in the water.\n\nOnce there is a long enough path (roughly five stones long), mine the rubble and let My Arm walk in. The trolls cease attacking and will take you to the city's leader \u2014 [[Mother]], his bodyguard [[Don't Know What]] and his inventor assistant [[Odd Mushroom]]. He also has a daughter, [[Snowflake]], with whom My Arm falls in love.\n\nOnce Mother asks what My Arm has to offer to the trolls of Weiss, pick every chat option possible. Mother will be uninterested in any of the offerings My Arm has to make any business with Weiss, and he is adamant that trolls only need to be concerned about physical strength and prowess; he also wants his daughter to marry Don't Know What, who would inherit the throne once Mother dies.\n[[File:Making Friends with My Arm - troll invasion.png|thumb|250px|Once upon a time, the Weiss trolls attacked the dwarves of Keldagrim...]]\nHaving nothing to offer to Mother, you and My Arm leave the the hut. Outside, speak to My Arm, and pick every chat option once more. You will learn from Odd Mushroom that the trolls of Weiss once lived further south near [[Keldagrim]], and was driven away by a then-young [[Wise Old Man]]. A plan is devised to let My Arm impress Mother by faking the killing of Wise Old Man, a long-time enemy of the Weiss trolls.\n\n===The Wise \"Dead\" Man===\n''Items required:\u00a0[[Hammer]], [[saw]], 5 [[mahogany plank]]s, a [[bolt of cloth]], [[cadava berries]].''\n\nMake way to [[Draynor Village]] where you will have to talk to the [[Wise Old Man]]. Ask him to help [[My Arm]]. He will initially refuse, as he is more of an adventurer than a family mediator; after reminding him of you saving his life during [[Swan Song]], he will agree to help you.\n\nHe will ask that you build a mahogany coffin and have the [[Apothecary]] brew a [[cadava potion]] that is suited for his age. The coffin can be built next to him, granting the player 715 [[Construction]] experience.\n\nMake your way to the Apothecary in [[Varrock]], and have him make a [[reduced cadava potion]]. Return to the Wise Old Man and talk to him. He will then drink the potion and \"die\". Pick up the [[old man's coffin]], and make your way back to [[Weiss]], and speak to My Arm.\n\nMy Arm will now offer the Wise Old Man's \"corpse\" to [[Mother]], but he doubts its authenticity due to a lack of battle wounds. [[Odd Mushroom]] will attempt to persuade Mother to accept My Arm into the tribe and have [[Snowflake]] marry him, but Mother is still set in his ways, claiming that she needs to marry a proper troll like [[Don't Know What]].\n[[File:Making Friends with My Arm - My Arm's deceit.png|thumb|250px|My Arm, Snowflake, Odd Mushroom and you attempt to convince Mother that My Arm killed the Wise Old Man.]]\nSnowflake will then become enraged at Mother, telling him he shouldn't tell her how to think and love, and declaring her love for My Arm. He still insists that My Arm is not to be trusted. Suddenly, the Wise Old Man begins snoring. Odd Mushroom will claim that it is the remains of his magic escaping his body. The Wise Old Man will then break wind, convincing Mother that this is all a trick. He will then lock you, My Arm, Snowflake, a mortally wounded Odd Mushroom, and the now-awake Wise Old Man in a cell.\n\nTalk to Odd Mushroom. He will tell you that Mother has lit a Fire of Domination, which drastically increases his strength and prevents teleportation magic from working, indicating his intention to kill everyone. Odd Mushroom will instruct you to find his notes where he writes down his inventions, so that Snowflake can carry on with his inventions. Shortly afterwards, Odd Mushroom passes away from his wounds. Snowflake will then ask you to kill her father as revenge for killing Odd Mushroom.\n\n===Patricide===\n''Items required:\u00a0[[Combat equipment]]''\n[[File:Making Friends with My Arm - fighting Don't Know What.png|thumb|left|220px|Fighting Don't Know What.]]\nThe [[Wise Old Man]] will break the cell door, and [[Don't Know What]] will attack. He uses [[ranged]] attacks that can hit through the player's [[protection prayers]]. He has 220 [[Hitpoints]], and is very resistant to [[magic]], so [[melee]] or ranged attacks are recommended. Even though [[Snowflake]], [[My Arm]] and the Wise Old Man assist you in the fight, they will not do much damage.\n\nIf players need to escape, they must use the smelly hole found within the cell. This will take them outside of [[Weiss]] right next to the boat.\n[[File:Making Friends with My Arm - fighting Mother.png|thumb|220px|You and the gang battle against Snowflake's father, Mother.]]\nAfter defeating Don't Know What, you and the gang will have to fight [[Mother]], who plans to kill Snowflake. Before fighting him, you must take a [[bucket]] next to the large barrel of water and extinguish the Fire of Domination, or else none of your attacks will hit. The fight is similar to Don't Know What's, in which he will launch boulders toward the player that can hit through protection prayers, and will occasionally pummel the player backwards.\n\n===A New Leader===\n''Items required:\u00a0[[Bucket]]''\n\nAfter killing [[Mother]], [[Snowflake]] will call all the trolls of [[Weiss]] and declare herself as the new leader of Weiss, with all of them in agreement, claiming she is much nicer than Mother. She will then ask you to perform the wedding ceremony for her and [[My Arm]]; they will say their vows, and you will pronounce them as husband and wife. They will then perform the ancient dance of love (which is following each other at the same time).\n\n<gallery>\nMaking Friends with My Arm - stepping up as leader.png|Snowflake declares herself the new leader of Weiss.\nMaking Friends with My Arm - wedding.png|The wedding ceremony of Snowflake and My Arm.\nMaking Friends with My Arm - ancient dance of love.png|The newlyweds performing the ancient dance of love.\nMaking Friends with My Arm - Snowflake and My Arm forever.png|Snowflake and My Arm forever!\n</gallery>\n\nAfter the ceremony, Snowflake will ask you to fetch some [[goat dung]] for her. Goat dung can be found in the north-east building. You will need a [[bucket]] to pick up the dung; you should still have it from the fight against Mother. If not, simply pick up another bucket next to the large barrel of water.\n\nReturn to Snowflake, who will make two [[herb patches]] just west; one to grow [[goutweed]], and one for you. She will then give you [[Odd Mushroom]]'s [[Weiss fire notes]], which contains the information required to light braziers. Read it, and speak to her once more.\n\n'''Congratulations! Quest complete!'''\n\n'''Optional post-quest reward''' - Players can return to [[Burntmeat]] and [[Wolfbone]] to inform them of the situation in [[Weiss]], and to give Burntmeat the [[Weiss fire notes]]. As Burntmeat has felt that you dislike his burnt meat, he will have Wolfbone reward you instead. Humorously, Wolfbone gives you [[burnt meat]] as a reward, while Burntmeat eats the notes you gave him, much to your annoyance.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Making Friends with My Arm\n|image = [[File:Making Friends With My Arm reward scroll.png|center]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards =\n*{{Skill clickpic|Construction|2,000}} [[Construction]] [[experience]]\n*{{Skill clickpic|Firemaking|5,000}} [[Firemaking]] [[experience]]\n*{{Skill clickpic|Mining|10,000}} [[Mining]] [[experience]]\n*{{Skill clickpic|Agility|10,000}} [[Agility]] [[experience]]\n*Access to the [[Salt Mine]]s\n*Ability to build [[fire pit]]s\n*A new [[Disease (Farming)|disease]]-free [[herb patch]] in [[Weiss]] (requires building the [[fire pit]] before use)\n*Ability to direct a teleport room portal to Troll Stronghold with a combination of salt\n}}\n\n==Music unlocked==\n*[[Barren Land]] - Unlocked outside [[Weiss]]\n*[[Troll Shuffle]] - Unlocked when attempting to sneak around Weiss\n*[[Lumbering]] - Unlocked when properly entering Weiss\n*[[Mother Ruckus]] - Unlocked during the fight with [[Mother]]\n*[[Snowflake & My Arm]] - Unlocked during [[Snowflake]] and [[My Arm]]'s wedding ceremony\n\n==Pre-release gallery==\n<gallery>\nMaking Friends with My Arm teaser 1.jpg|Mod Ash shows My Arm's substitute for the Trollheim herb patch, [[Drunken dwarf's leg]].\nMaking Friends with My Arm teaser 2.jpg|Mod Ash shows My Arm arriving near Weiss.\nMaking Friends with My Arm teaser 3.jpg|Mod Ash shows various screenshots from the quest.\nMaking Friends with My Arm teaser 4.jpg|Mod Ash shows more screenshots from the quest.\nMaking Friends with My Arm teaser 5.png|Mod Ash shows a particular cutscene from the quest.\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*While speaking to the [[Apothecary]], and having the required [[cadava berry]] before he asks you for it, he will tell you \"''That's very clever.

It is directly south of the [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]]. In order to save the outpost from [[King Lathas]], the player will need to talk to [[Silver merchant|Erin the silver merchant]], [[Droalak]] the ghost, and [[Dron]] the warrior. They can be visited in any order, and the player does not need to visit Jorral until meeting all the characters. Before all of this, Jorral takes you into a cutscene.\n\nNote: If the door is open when talking to Jorral, occasionally an aggressive hobgoblin can attack you during the cutscene, which will cancel the dialogue afterwards and force you to watch the cutscene over again.\n\n===Erin the silver merchant===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Spade]].''\n\nGo to [[East Ardougne|East]] [[Ardougne]], and talk to [[Silver merchant|Erin]], the Silver Merchant who works on the [[Ardougne Silver Stall|silver stall]] at the market. He will give the player a [[Enchanted key|key]]. It is used to find a buried chest. The closer the player is to the chest, the warmer the key. There are six temperatures: freezing, very cold, warm, very hot, burning hot, and steaming hot. When the key is steaming hot, the player is on the right spot and will need to use the spade to recover the chest. The key will also tell the player whether it is hotter or colder since its last use.\n\n[[File:Chest location for making history quest.png|frame|Chest location|left]]\nPlayers may now teleport to [[Castle Wars]] using the [[ring of dueling]]. The key should lead the player to an area south of the [[observatory]] near the river, north of Castle Wars. The area to dig is on white flowers. Click the [[spade]] when the key is steaming hot. Use the Enchanted key on the chest to open it to get a [[journal (Making History)|journal]], and read it to learn about a [[Zamorak]]ian that used to live in the outpost who played pranks on the people of Ardougne.\n\nThe Enchanted key cannot be used to find additional treasure until this [[quest]] is complete. If the player uses the key, he or she gets the message, \"You have already found the chest\" (if not opened to get the journal yet) or, \"You have already found the journal\". If the player has already given the journal to Jorral, the message is, \"You've already delivered the journal.\"\n\n===Droalak the ghost===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Ghostspeak amulet]], [[Sapphire amulet]] (strung) and if the player has not completed [[Ghosts Ahoy]], see above.''\n\nTravel to [[Port Phasmatys]] (if [[Ghosts Ahoy]] has not been completed, pay two [[ecto-token]]s to the town guards or alternatively you can [[Charter ship|charter a boat]] to Port Phasmatys). Once inside, go to the [[general store]] and talk to [[Droalak]]. If he is not in the general store, he is wandering just outside of the general store. He will give the player a scroll if he or she gives his wife, [[Melina]], a strung [[sapphire amulet]]. Speak to Droalak again to let him know you have the amulet. Melina is in the building east of the general store. After giving her the amulet, the player must go back to Droalak to receive the scroll.\n\n===Dron the warrior===\nGo to [[Rellekka]]. East of the Longhall, talk to Dron's brother, [[Blanin]] (He can be found near the [[Dairy churn]] in [[Rellekka]]). Go north of the Skulgrimen's shop, and speak to [[Dron]]. He can be found close to the northernmost dock. He will quiz the player on the information that Blanin gave them. Dron will ask various questions; these are the answers (in the order used):\n\n*He wields an '''iron mace''' in battle.\n*He eats '''rats''' for '''breakfast'''.\n*He eats '''kittens '''for '''lunch'''.\n*He eats '''bunnies''' for '''tea'''.\n*His favourite drink is '''red '''spider blood.\n*He is '''36 years, 8 months (21 days) old.'''\n*He studies the '''Fifth '''and''' Fourth '''ages.\n*His house is on the '''northeast side''' of town.\n*His brother's name is '''Blanin'''.\n*His pet cat is named '''Fluffy'''.\n*5 and 7 is '''12'''\nTo get through the conversation quick, here are the numbers you can press (for the '''whole '''conversation): 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1.\n\nAfter answering the questions, Dron will tell the player a story about two friends.\n\n===Back to Jorral===\nGive everything to [[Jorral]]. He'll give the player a letter to take to the king of [[East Ardougne]]. [[King Lathas]] can be found upstairs in his [[Ardougne Castle|castle]] in central Ardougne just across the river. He will give back a letter to take to Jorral, in which he promises not to tear down the outpost. After taking it to Jorral, Jorral will make a museum out of the outpost.\n\n'''Congratulations!

King Arthur<br>2. Sirs Gawain and Kay<br>3. Sirs Lucan and Palomedes]]\nTo begin the quest, talk to\u00a0[[King Arthur]]\u00a0in [[Camelot]], east of [[Seers' Village]].\u00a0Ask him if you can join the Knights of the Round Table, and he'll suggest you complete a quest first to prove yourself. He'll tell you that his friend and mentor,\u00a0[[Merlin]],\u00a0has been trapped in a crystal, yet he cannot break him out of it. Arthur will tell you to ask the other knights if they have any ideas.\n\n===Gathering information===\n'''''Items required:''' None''\n\nGo talk to the other knights around [[Camelot]]. First, you should speak to\u00a0[[Sir Gawain]] (who can be found either roaming in the courtyard or inside the castle) and talk to him about [[Merlin]], be sure to discuss both options. He'll mention that perhaps [[Morgan Le Faye]] will know, since she created the enchantment. However, he does not know how to get into her [[Keep Le Faye|keep]].\n\nNext, talk to [[Sir Lancelot]] on the {{FloorNumber|2}} of Camelot Castle. Talk to him, and ask him if he has any idea on how to get into the Keep. He'll say something about how the only way to get into the [[Keep Le Faye]] is from the sea.\n\n===Infiltrating the keep===\n'''''Items required:''' An empty [[bucket]] (obtainable during quest) [[insect repellent]] (found in Catherby)''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' Combat equipment, food, [[Varrock teleport]], [[Amulet of glory]] or [[Falador teleport]]''\n\nNow that you've got a lead, head down the road to the south to\u00a0[[Catherby]].\u00a0Once in Catherby, just south of the [[bank]] is a general store merchant named [[Arhein]], he is standing at the start of the dock; speak with him about his boat and where it is going. In a house just north of the bank, you can find a bottle of\u00a0[[insect repellent]]\u00a0on a table; take it.\u00a0Grab some armour and go just north of the dock between the\u00a0bank\u00a0and the [[Candle Shop]], and you'll find a few crates against the back of the candle shop. You can click on them to hide inside. There will be a bit of dialogue as workers come to pack you up and put you in the boat. After a while, you'll end up in the [[Keep Le Faye]], when prompted choose yes to climb out.\n\n===Freeing Merlin===\n[[File:Merlin's Crystal - Fighting Sir Mordred.png|thumb|220px|Fighting Sir Mordred.]]\nWatch out for the [[renegade knight]]s that are wandering around the castle, and run up the stairs to the very top floor. Up here, you'll find\u00a0[[Sir Mordred]]\u00a0(level 39). Fight him, and just as you are about to defeat him, [[Morgan Le Faye]] will appear, begging you not to kill her son. In exchange for sparing him, she will finally tell you how to release [[Merlin]]. You will need a number of things to do so, noted below.\n:'''Note:''' Be careful not to interrupt the conversation, or you'll have to fight Sir Mordred again! Running out of prayer points will interrupt the dialogue.\n\n====Bat bones====\nThere are [[giant bat]]s (level 27) right outside the [[Keep Le Faye|Keep]]. Just go down the stairs to the {{FloorNumber|1}} to get outside and kill one. \n\n====Black candle====\nIf you need a [[bucket of wax]], head north from the keep where there is a fenced in area full of bee hives (near the\u00a0[[flax]]\u00a0field). Pick up the [[bucket]] near the gate, use the [[insect repellent]] on a hive to temporarily drive the bees away, and then use the bucket\u00a0to get some wax. If you have the bucket of wax already, you can return to [[Catherby]] by hiding in the crates on the docks at Keep Le Faye.\n\nTravel to the [[candle maker]] whose house is west of the Catherby\u00a0[[bank]]. Talk to him, and he'll tell you that he can make [[black candle]]s, but only if you bring him a bucket of wax. Talk to him again with the wax, and he will give you the black candle.\n\n====Excalibur====\n[[File:Merlin's Crystal - Lady of the Lake.png|thumb|220px|The Lady of the Lake]]\n'''''Items required:''' [[Bread]]''\n\nThe sword is kept by\u00a0[[The Lady of the Lake]]. To find her, go south-east of [[Taverley]] to the lake.\u00a0The Lady of the Lake will be in the peninsula within the lake. Talk to her, and she'll tell you that she has the sword; however, she wants you to go to the jewellery shop in\u00a0[[Port Sarim]]\u00a0first.\n[[File:Merlin's Crystal - The beggar.png|thumb|left|220px|Talking to the beggar.]]\nAlong the way, grab a loaf of\u00a0[[bread]], then head to Port Sarim. As you open the door to the jewel shop, a beggar will approach you, begging you for some food to feed his starving family. Give him the loaf of bread. When you do, he will then change into the Lady of the Lake, who was simply testing the purity of your spirit. Satisfied, she'll give you the sword\u00a0[[Excalibur]].\n\n'''<span style=\"color:red\">Warning: </span>'''Do not click anything but \"Click here to continue\" in the dialogue box, not even \"Talk to Lady of the Lake\", until you get the sword.

In the building, there is an\u00a0altar which must be checked to find the words needed:\u00a0'''Snarthon Candtrick Termanto'''. Make sure to click continue to complete the dialog.\n\n'''<span style=\"color:red\">Warning:</span>''' You '''must''' go read the words on the altar, or you won't be able to progress further through the quest.\n\n===Finishing up===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Excalibur]], [[black candle]], [[tinderbox]], [[bat bones]], [[food]] and a [[weapon]] (last 2 optional but recommended).''\n[[File:Merlin's Crystal - Thrantax the Mighty.png|thumb|220px|The demon.]]\nNow to free the wizard. First, head back to\u00a0[[Camelot]]. The magical symbol is on the north-east side of the castle just inside the fence. Light your black candle and\u00a0''drop''\u00a0the bat bones ('''be careful\u00a0not\u00a0to bury them''') in the circle. A demonic spirit named [[Thrantax the Mighty]] will appear, and you will be prompted to say the magic words:\u00a0'''Snarthon Candtrick Termanto'''. If you get it right, the spirit will obey you.\n:'''Note:''' If you recite the wrong phrase, the spirit will attack you and you will have to get a new black candle and try again. Be careful as it's level 92, with a max hit of 10, and it can hit rather accurately.\n\nOnce the spirit is under your control, you'll make your request to free [[Merlin]], and the spirit will do as you wish. Now, go back inside Camelot Castle, and climb up to the very top of the south-east tower. At the top, Merlin will be imprisoned in a blue crystal. Use [[Excalibur]] on the crystal, and it will shatter.\n\nHead back down and talk to [[King Arthur]] to finish the quest.\u00a0'''Congratulations!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Merlin&#39;s Crystal\n|image = [[File:Merlin&#39;s Crystal reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 6\n|rewards = \n*[[Excalibur]]\n}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*Merlin's Crystal gives six [[quest points]], the most of any single quest (other than the compound quest, [[Recipe for Disaster]]), despite being relatively easy.\n*Merlin can be seen in his workshop prior to being released from his crystal if another player enters the workshop to interact with him.\n\n==Required for completing==\n*[[Holy Grail]]\n*[[Heroes' Quest]]\n*[[King's Ransom]]\n\n{{Merlin's Crystal}}\n[[Category:Merlin's Crystal]]"], "Misthalin Mystery": ["{{Has quick guide}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Misthalin Mystery\n|number = 130\n|image = [[File:Misthalin Mystery.png|300px]]\n|members = No\n|release = 26 January [[2017]]\n|update = Prayers Scrolls, QoL & a Quest\n|series = None\n|difficulty = Novice\n|developer = Mod Jed, Mod TomH,\nMod West, Mod Ash\n}}\n'''Misthalin Mystery''' is a standalone [[quest]], being the 130th quest in ''[[Old School RuneScape]]''.

Board the rowboat south of them. Head through the gate, directly west is a fountain. Pick up a [[bucket]] next to the fountain. Head north of the fountain to trigger a cutscene, where [[Sid]] is murdered by the [[Killer]]. Use the bucket on the barrel of rainwater, and search it to obtain a [[manor key]].\n\n===Riddle 1===\n[[File:Misthalin Mystery - Tayten dies.png|thumb|left|200px|Tayten is murdered by the Killer.]]\nEnter the manor, pick up the [[knife]] on the table, and attempt to open the door with the pink knob up north. This will trigger another cutscene, where [[Tayten]] is murdered by the [[killer]] hiding in the wardrobe. Before returning in the wardrobe, he slides a [[Notes (Misthalin Mystery - 1)|note]] under the door. Pick it up and read it.\n\n[[File:Misthalin_Mystery_-_painting.png|thumb|The painting slashed with a knife.]]\nThe riddle refers to a painting found in the adjacent room to the southwest. The painting is one with mountains, a blue river, and the sun on the horizon (on the east side of the room). Use the knife on it, and search it to find a [[ruby key]]. The doorknobs on the doors throughout the mansion will indicate the appropriate key that opens them.\n\nOpen the eastern door, and take a [[tinderbox]] from the shelves. Light all four unlit candles in the room, and you will get a message the room is warm enough to dry the fuse attached to the barrel of explosives. Then, use the tinderbox on the barrel next to the damaged wall. Exit the room to trigger the explosion.\n\n===Riddle 2===\n[[File:Misthalin Mystery - Lacey dies.png|thumb|200px|Lacey is murdered by the Killer.]]\nClimb over the wall, and head north of the manor to trigger another cutscene, where [[Lacey]] is tied up. The [[Killer]] will ask her the name of the vampyre who lives in South Misthalin, but players will be given a choice; none of options matter, so pick any (the correct answer is actually [[Count Check]], but if you say it, the Killer will kill Lacey for you interfering). She will die and the Killer will leave players [[Notes (Misthalin Mystery - 2)|another note]]. Pick it up and read it.\n\nIt's like music to my ears!\n<br />The glorious sounds, spelling out your fate!\n\nThe riddle refers to the piano found in the north-eastern corner of the manor (music). You must enter the room through the the damaged north eastern wall. The Killer wants you dead - play the notes D-E-A-D on the piano, and search it to find an [[emerald key]].\n\n===Riddle 3===\n[[File:Misthalin Mystery - Mandy dies.png|thumb|left|200px|Mandy is murdered by the Killer.]]\nReturn inside the manor by climbing the damaged east wall, and open the door with the emerald doorknob where the first note was found. Attempt to open the kitchen doors where [[Mandy]] is found, and another cutscene will occur where she is killed by the [[Killer]]. Once again, he will leave players [[Notes (Misthalin Mystery - 3)|a third note]]. Pick it up and read it.\n[[File:Misthalin Mystery - Gemstone switch panel.png|thumb|left|200px|The correct solution to the gemstone switch panel.]]\n\n<br />'''H'''ear at first these word'''s'''.\n<br />'''E'''ach murder you witness helplessly from start to en'''d'''.\n<br />'''A'''s you fail to solve the final letters of this qui'''z'''.\n<br />'''R'''azor sharp like a gemstone is the blade of my knif'''e'''.\n<br />'''T'''he last sound you hear will be your scream's ech'''o'''.\n<br />'''H'''eed that I will have the final word in this thrille'''r'''.\n\nThe riddle refers to the unlit fireplace in the eastern room (HEARTH). Use the [[knife]] on the unlit fireplace to reveal a panel of switches inside the hidden compartment. The correct solution corresponds to the final letter of each sentence. Therefore, to open the compartment, click the following in order (sdzeor): Sapphire - Diamond - Zenyte - Emerald - Onyx - Ruby. Search the fireplace once more to find a [[sapphire key]].\n\n===Showdown===\n[[File:Misthalin Mystery - confronting Killer.png|thumb|left|200px|Showdown with the mysterious Killer.]]\nOpen the westernmost door, and a cutscene will occur where the player confronts the [[Killer]].\n\nHe will hide in wardrobes and throw knives. The player must push the mirror and have it face the wardrobe he is found in. The player can know which wardrobe he's in by looking for a brief black shadow surrounding the wardrobe.\n[[File:Misthalin Mystery - two Killers.png|thumb|200px|They were the two killers all along!]]\nAfter defeating the Killer, players will discover that the killer was [[Abigale]] all along! She complains about how adventurers always take all the glory from her when she tries to help others every year.

Players who completed the quest before the reward was added were told to speak with [[Mandy]] outside the Mansion to receive the additional reward.\n*The mansion in this quest is based on [[Draynor Manor]].\n*No music plays at all during the quest. If you were to travel to the island and then log out and back in, you would find that your music player is playing nothing at all.\n*This quest is based on the movie ''Scream'', particularly when the Killer asks \"What is your favorite scary quest?\". 'Quest' is used instead of 'Movie'.\n*There is a [[Bandos godsword]] within the room where [[Mandy]] is, although there is currently no way the player is able to reach the weapon. Strangely, the Godsword has the 'Take' option on it despite the inaccessibility.\n*The examine text for both killers is a pun on their respective names. For Hewey, \"He's on the wrong side of the law\" is presumably a reference to the nickname for a military helicopter, the Huey. Likewise, \"She has stirred up quite the storm\" for Abigale refers to the 'gale' within her name.\n*The Island is still part of the Kingdom of Misthalin, but the bit they don't talk about, where even the guards daren't go. https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1014629951734190080\n\n{{Misthalin Mystery}}"], "Monk's Friend": ["{{External|rs|rsc}}\n{{Has quick guide}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Monk's Friend\n|number = 27\n|image = [[File:Monk's Friend.png|300px]]\n|members = Yes\n|release = 28 May  [[2002]]\n|update = Latest RuneScape News (28 May 2002)\n|series = None\n|difficulty = Novice\n|developer = Tom W.\n}}\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Speak to [[Brother Omad]] at the [[Ardougne Monastery|monastery]] south of [[Ardougne]].

The rocks can be avoided by sheltering under the numerous overhangs (grey areas on the map above), but can be largely ignored. The claw traps near the end of the dungeon can be easily avoided by stopping one square behind them and then running through; the plank is not actually needed, but can also be placed on the flat rock.

Alternatively, you can go upstairs and climb down the ladder to get very close to the trapdoor. Hide in the north-east corner of the temple until there is enough room which you are able to descend. '''Be careful not to get surrounded or cornered by the monkey guards, or else you may be unable to escape (if you happen to get surrounded, go up the stairs and hop worlds) .

To the west of that building, there should be a banana garden that has a [[Monkey Child]] in it. The Monkey Child is being patrolled by [[The Monkey's Aunt]]. She\u00a0follows a predetermined path that loops around the wooden house by the garden. Do not enter the banana garden when the monkey's aunt is present or she will call for guards to arrest you (if this happens, you can escape by quickly climbing up the ladder in the building beside). Wait for the aunt to walk away, then speak to the monkey child.\n'''Tip''': Using the ladder in the monkey's aunt's house nearby can help you escape the guards if the monkey's aunt catches you, but do not speak to [[The Monkey's Uncle]] upstairs or else he will call the guards too.\n#Tell the monkey child that you are his uncle.\n#After he reveals that he is supposed to collect 20 [[bananas]], search and pick five (5) from the nearby trees. '''You do not actually need 20.'''\n#Wait for a few moments in the corridor, then return to the monkey child when the aunt is away. Ask the child to borrow his [[Monkey talisman]]. The drop trick can be used to get more than one; you will need to drop it and then speak to the monkey child, telling him you have lost the talisman. Then wait or hop worlds as the monkey child will start to cry and will not immediately give you another one. Alternatively, talismans can be purchased from [[Tutab's Magical Market]] for 1000 [[coins]]. '''You won't be able to access the shop to obtain the first talisman as you must be in monkey form.'''

For all of the bones, you must kill one of each of the following:\u00a0[[Monkey (monster)]], [[Monkey Archer]], [[Monkey Zombie]] and [[Monkey Guard]]. '''A Monkey Guard can be killed ''much'' more easily by safespotting it, they will only heal in melee range.''' The easiest ones to kill are located upstairs. Go through the front entrance (have Protect from Melee on then turn it off once you get up the ladder) then head for the southern ladder. You will find yourself in a corridor where you can safespot the guard. Once you have all of the required bones and talismans, take all 4 bones and 4 talismans to Zooknock to create them. If he does not take the next bones you give him right after he gives you your greegree, talk to him, and ask him to make another greegree.

He will give you a [[10th squad sigil]]. '''Do not equip it''' until you are ready for the final battle!

If you teleport back into battle immediately, you can recover any other lost items.'''\n#Bank in preparation for the [[Jungle Demon]] fight. Ensure you have full [[prayer points]] and health. The Jungle Demon is best defeated by using a [[Dwarf multicannon]], by [[ranging]]/[[maging]], or by luring the demon into the 10th Squad gnomes. To determine your strategy, choose whichever of the three suggested methods would work best for your skill. Bring [[prayer potion]]s, good food ([[lobsters]] or better), and a one-click teleport out just in case. [[Protect from Magic]] is crucial, and should ideally be turned on just before you teleport. Bring an [[antipoison]] as well for the post-battle sequence.\n#When you are ready to fight, wear the sigil. You will be teleported to the Jungle Demon's arena shortly thereafter. Defeat the Jungle Demon to advance. The 10th Squad gnomes will be nearby to help you, but '''you must deal the final blow yourself, or the demon will heal for 25% of his max health'''.\n#'''Strategy for Ranged/Magic:''' Attacking with [[Magic]] or [[Ranged]] as well as having 37+ [[Prayer]] is recommended. There is a [[safespot]] in the arena across a bridge on the outside edge. From there, you can either range him, or lure him into the 10th Squad gnomes, who can weaken him. Once the Jungle Demon is within lethal range, with Protect from Magic still activated, run up to the Jungle Demon and Melee it once and run back. This will prevent the Jungle Demon from using his Melee attack while he continues to hit you with Magic which you protect from. '''Standing still''' once you are teleported to the arena will keep distance between you and the Jungle Demon. The demon will not move, and thus will not be able to approach you and use its [[Melee]] attack, which will result in you taking no damage throughout the fight as long as you keep your prayer up.\n#'''Strategy for Melee:''' Using [[rings of recoil]] will help, especially when he hits hard. When the Jungle Demon reaches 1 HP from the gnomes, there will be a period of a few seconds before it regenerates its health. You can use Melee with this method.[[File:Bonzara teleport.gif|frame|centre|Bonzara teleports a player.]]\n#Once the Jungle Demon is slain, speak to Garkor, who is indicated by an arrow. He will tell you to speak to Zooknock to be teleported out. Speak to Zooknock to be teleported to Ape Atoll. If players decline the offer and stay, they are free to explore the [[Banana plantation (Ape Atoll)|banana plantation]]. However, Zooknock leaves, meaning that the other gnomes are the player's teleport out. In the base of the statue is a crack, which players can enter and speak to [[Bonzara]]. He offers to teleport the player out of the arena at the end of the conversation. \n* '''Warning:''' Both teleporters will put you in the jungle on Ape Atoll near [[poisonous]] and [[aggressive]] monsters, so be sure to have [[anti-poison]]!

The greegree will lose its effectiveness when you enter the cave and \"wrench itself from your hands.\" '''<u>If your inventory is full, the greegree will drop to the ground when you enter.</u>'''\n#[[Kruk]] is located behind the handholds north of the entrance. You will have to walk across the whole dungeon which is full of traps, [[Agility]] obstacles and monsters to reach him. There are two ways to approach the dungeon.\n\nBelow is a map of [[Kruk's Dungeon]]:\n[[File:Kruk's Dungeon map.png|thumb|600px|centre]]\n\n====The Agility Method (70+ recommended)====\n:'''Note:''' The correct path is random for every player.\n\n[[File:Bumpy ground path.png|thumb|220px|Path through the dodgy ground.]]\nThe [[Agility]] section will consist of many obstacles in which there is only one correct path. You will often have to find out which course is the right way using trial and error. You can fall navigating the obstacles; however, if the game gives a message stating \"Something about this route feels wrong...\", that path has a 100% fail rate for you. A light source is recommended as the bottom floor is dark, and you will be bitten by insects continually until you leave the area.\n\nIf you fall during the first two vines, you will drop in a location filled with [[Maniacal monkey]]s, which only use melee on you. If you fall after the third vine, you will fall into an area with [[Maniacal Monkey Archer]]s, which use range instead. Be aware that each vine serves as a \"checkpoint\" of sorts, so you cannot simply go to the bottom floor and cut through the whole maze.\n\n*To begin the agility method, you will want to start heading south and then east. When you first begin the course, you will come across the \"Dodgy Ground\". All you have to do is to follow the flat-looking parts of the ground. (Stepping onto one of the parts covered with an \"X\" will result in you setting off the trap, and you will fall.)\n\n[[File:Bronze_key_(MM2)_location.png|thumb|The location of the chest that possesses the bronze key.]]\n*Continue passing obstacles until you reach a very large room filled with the Dodgy Ground. You will need to get to the door on the east side. Follow the correct path on the ground until you make it to the chest. Unlock (right click) and search the chest to receive the [[Bronze key (Monkey Madness II)|bronze key]].\n'''Note:''' If you need to teleport out before you reach the end of the dungeon (reaching the strange wall), taking a second key is recommended to save time.\n*Go back out onto the dodgy ground, and make your way north. Use your bronze key on another door to continue through the maze.\n*Once you make it to the northern end of the cave past all the obstacles, take the '''western''' corridor to go to Kruk's lair. The eastern corridor is the tanking path.\nWARNING: If you should teleport out or die after passing the bronze door you need to get the bronze key again!\n\n====The Tanking Method====\n'''''Recommended:''' Good [[tanking]] [[equipment]]''\n:'''Note:''' If you choose this method, you '''must''' bring a [[slash weapon]] to break webs and a [[pickaxe]] to clear rocks.\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - crossing Kruk's dungeon.png|thumb|220px|A player navigating through obstacles in Kruk's dungeon.]]\n*The dungeon is in a oval sort of shape, so it is pretty straightforward to navigate your way through it. The tunnels are all [[multi-combat]]. There are many aggressive monkeys, in addition to the odd scorpion or snake.\n**The monkeys can deal very high damage quickly, even with good tanking equipment. It is recommended to use [[Protect from Missiles]] as the monkey archers have a much longer range and deal just as much damage as the melee ones.\n*For your consumables if taking the tanking route, it is best to bring [[saradomin brew]]s to get as much healing as possible. [[Super restore]]s are not needed unless you are planning to kill Kruk on the same run.\n**Runes for [[blood burst]] or [[blood barrage|barrage]] are useful to heal off the maniacal monkeys if you need to.\n*Make your way through the dungeon slashing webs. If you find a web that is \"too strong to slash\", you are going the wrong way.\n*At some point in the dungeon, you will find three chests. You will need to unlock the chests by right clicking and selecting unlock chest; if the game says it resists your attempts to open it, try to unlock the other chest. If it opens, search it for a '''[[Combat damaged key]]''', which is used to open a door further ahead. Taking a second one is advised if you need to bank before reaching the end of the dungeon. Note that one chest is further down the path. Alternatively you can skip getting the key and pick-lock the door later.\n*After the door, there will be several traps ahead of you, including dart dispensers and spinning blades. You can tinker with them to disable it for a short time. Like the other obstacles throughout the dungeon, you will know if you are going the wrong way if you cannot disable the trap.\n\n====Reaching Kruk====\nThe two paths converge at the north end of the dungeon. Continue west, where there is another vine serving as the final \"checkpoint\". There are three Maniacal monkeys near it, so pray melee until they cannot reach you. The path will then divide into an western and eastern route, then a final wave of dodgy ground. '''Before passing the last dodgy ground''', investigate the wall to unlock a shortcut back to the entrance.\n\nIf needed, go to a bank and prepare for the battle against Kruk. Use the shortcut when you return to skip to the end of the cave. A cavern entrance will lead to Kruk's chamber.\n\n====Killing Kruk====\n<span style=\"color:red\">'''Warning:'''</span> [[Kruk]] can be very difficult to kill. '''<u>''The lair is instanced, which means any dropped items will disappear and cannot be reclaimed.''</u>'''\n*When you enter the room with [[Kruk]], there will be some short dialogue. Turn on '''[[Protect from Missiles]]''' and attack Kruk. '''He can hit up to 33.''' Kruk has no particular weakness to any attack style.\n*When attacking Kruk, the best method is to attack with range using stamina potions. This is similar to fighting Commander Zilyana. Attack and run away and stay out of melee range. This method reduces the amount of high hits from Kruk. Keep in mind you will still be hit by certain ranged attacks. It may be optimal to pray Eagle Eye and Steel Skin, or Rigour, in addition to Protect from Missiles.\u00a0\n*Kruk can also be [[safespot]]ted and [[flinch]]ed from the western wall\u00a0\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - fighting Kruk.png|thumb|220px|The player faces Kruk.]]\n*Given high enough combat, Kruk can be easily meleed without flinching with protection from melee and piety, while only using a few sharks to be safe.\n*After defeated, take '''[[Kruk's paw]]''' and exit the dungeon through the rope to west of the chamber. This rope will lead you back up in the ruined building where you hid from the monkey's aunt during Monkey Madness.\n*You now need to make a [[Kruk monkey greegree]]. You must navigate through the [[Ape Atoll Dungeon|tunnel]] you originally trekked through during the original [[Monkey Madness I]].\n:'''Note:''' Wearing a [[greegree]] will prevent you from being attacked by the undead monkeys and [[spider]]s inside (an antipoison or similar will make you immune to spike damage), but falling rocks will still damage you. It is highly advised to bring a [[stamina potion]], [[super energy potion]]s and [[food]] when going to [[Zooknock]].\n*Speak to Zooknock, and talk to him about the quest you are on\u2014he will create the Kruk monkey greegree for you.\n*Teleport out of the dungeon once you get the greegree and return to Ape Atoll.\n*Wield your new greegree and speak with [[King Awowogei]]. He will reveal that the monkeys are planning another attack with the help of some [[troll general]]s. With this information, talk with [[Garkor]] to finish Chapter II.\n\n===Chapter III===\n'''''Items required:''' Weapon, armour, and exactly 20 coins (for Gu'Tanoth).''\n'''''Recommended:''' Ape Atoll teleport, Trollheim teleport, Yanille or Castle Wars teleports for fast access to [[Gu'Tanoth]], food.''[[File:Monkey Madness II - Fighting Kob.png|thumb|220px|The player challenges Kob to a deathmatch.]]\nHead to the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]] near the [[troll general]]s\u2014there will be [[Kob]]; fight him ([[pray melee]] or [[safespot]] by walking through the door; he can't walk through it). It is '''highly recommended''' to use the [[Protect from Melee]] prayer before speaking to him and and accepting his challenge, as he can hit up to 57. Although Kob can hit through [[Protect from Melee]], he will deal far less damage if it is active. Players can safespot Kob by running out to the door, as he will not be able to reach you. However, note that using a [[halberd]] '''will''' prevent him from reaching/attacking you. When he is defeated, Kob will beg for mercy and agree to not help the monkeys.\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - Fighting Keef.png|thumb|left|220px|The player and Keef fight to the death.]]\nYou will then need to go to [[Gu'Tanoth]] and find [[Keef]], who can be found near the other [[city guard]]s past all the bridges (where you solved the riddle a guard gave you in the [[Watchtower Quest]]). You may need to steal a rock cake and/or bring 20 [[coins]] to pass the bridges again. '''(If you have more than 20 coins, it will work.)''' Challenge Keef to a deathmatch; like Kob, Keef can hit through protection prayers, albeit at a reduced output. As Keef is a large [[NPC]], you can use the nearby tree, for example, as a safespot. '''Be sure to activate Protect from Melee before you enter the dialogue with him.''' When Keef nears death, he will beg for mercy and agree not to help the monkeys.\n:'''Note:''' Before returning to [[Garkor]], it is recommended that you equip [[weight-reducing clothing]] and bring [[Energy potion|energy]], [[super energy]], or [[stamina potion]]s for the final section of the chapter. Also, don't forget your '''[[Kruk greegree]] and your [[m'speak amulet]].'''\n\nReturn to Garkor to tell him that the [[ogre]]s and [[troll]]s have agreed not to help the monkeys.\n[[File:Assistant Le Smith location.png|thumb|220px|A possible location of Assistant Le Smith.]]\nHe will tell you to go and look for [[Assistant Le Smith]], who can be found somewhere on [[Ape Atoll]] on the rooftops or other high places within the city. Common locations are:\n*On top of the bridge that connects the two watchtowers of the entrance.\n*Top floor of the jail. Use the northern ladder on the first (UK) floor of the jail.\n*Top floor of the building next to the rune stall. To access this building, go to the building east of the rune shop and search the SE crate to enter a cave. Go to the west end of the cave and climb up the rope.\n*Top floor of the broken building next to the [[monkey child]] and [[The Monkey's Aunt|aunt]].\nSpeak with Le Smith by telling him that you were going to ask him the same question followed by asking him why and about the ships, and he will inform you that the monkeys are constructing a fleet of ships on the west coast of Ape Atoll.\n\nTalk to Garkor before heading west to the north western coast of Ape Atoll. While wielding the Kruk greegree, speak with the monkey by the rowboat. He will take you to the platform.\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - airship platform map.png|thumb|left|A labeled map of the airship platform.]]\n[[File:Airship platform.png|thumb|220px|The airship platform.]]\nNow, on the platform, you will be transformed back into human form. You will have to collect six [[Satchel (Monkey Madness II)|satchels]], fill them with explosives, and then place the charges around the platform. Begin by following the main path, skipping the first ladder you get to. Continue until there is a ladder at a dead end. Go up the ladder (note that there is another ladder to go up; ignore it for now, but this will be important later), and continue south until you reach another ladder. Climb down this ladder and follow the path to find the satchels. Make sure to collect six satchels before going back up the ladder you just climbed down, around the corner, and back down to the {{FloorNumber|1}}. Return to the first ladder you encountered, climb up, and follow the path around until you reach another ladder. Climb down this ladder and follow the path north, and you will eventually reach a barrel with the explosives. Fill up '''all''' of your satchels before making your way to each of the locations where charges must be placed.\n\nGuards are all over the platform, and if you get caught by one, the guard will throw you out of the platform. Each guard's line of sight (LoS) is 2-3 squares in front of them. \"Corner tricking\" the guards are highly advised as it can save time. You may want to memorise the patrol patterns of the guards so you do not accidentally bump into one.\n\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - airship platform.png|thumb|220px|A player stealthily navigating through the airship platform.]]\n:<span style=\"color:red\">'''Warning:'''</span> If you are caught by the guards, the explosives will be soaked and become useless, forcing you to get more explosives again. However, any charges you've already planted will stay on the rig, even if you log out. '''When you finish planting all the charges, DO NOT teleport out; leave via the same ladder you came in. Leaving at any point in this way will not reset the explosives.'''\n\n[[File:Corner tricking.gif|thumb|220px|Corner tricking a guard]]\nCharges must be placed on two pillars on the {{FloorNumber|1}}, two floorboards on the middle floor, and two gas canisters on the top floor. One of the floorboards is immediately south of the ladder when you climb back up. One of the pillars is back towards the start. Planting a satchel on a pillar along the way, go back to the dead end ladder on the ground floor and climb up. Up again is to the two gas canisters (in each direction), while the last floorboard is to the west across a vine swing and to the north. Note that you can cross the middle of the first floor via a vine jump. Once you plant the last explosive, your character should acknowledge this. Leave the platform '''VIA THE LADDER by the ladder at which you arrived''' (to speed up this part, you can let a guard find and throw you out of the platform). Leaving this way at any point will not reset the explosives.\n\n[[File:Talking to Glough.png|thumb|220px|The player sat atop a mutated gorilla, discussing plans with Glough.]]\nAfter reporting back to Garkor, head back to Kruk's Dungeon where you defeated [[Kruk]] in the maze. If you forgot to bring a hammer and chisel, you can search the crates downstairs where you fight the gorillas in the next step, until you find one of each. You can skip traversing the maze by heading north and using the monkey bars with Kruk's greegree equipped. There should be a passage to enter once you have crossed the monkey bars, in the room just past where Kruk was found. Make sure to equip [[Kruk's greegree]] and enter. Walk through the big doors straight ahead, climb onto the [[stunted demonic gorilla]], and climb down the stairs where three [[Tortured gorilla]]s roam.\n\nGlough will appear, and order you to send the three tormented gorillas back into the cage. Riding on your demonic gorilla, attack all three tormented gorillas one at a time. Use [[Protect from Melee]] to negate the damage they deal to you. When they reach low health, the gorillas will go back into the cage. Glough will teleport out to find Le Smith; go onto the nearby holding area to dismount from the demonic gorilla. Climb back up the stairs, unequip the greegree, and take the [[Charged onyx]] out of the device at the north end of the room. Use the chisel and hammer to [[Deconstructed onyx|deconstruct]] it, and place it back in. Investigate any one of the incubation chambers to confirm they have been corrupted, and then report back to Garkor.\n\nGarkor will tell you to report to [[King Awowogei]] that his plans have been foiled. Do this, and return to Garkor. At this point, a cut-scene will play showing Glough proceeding with his attack plans anyway.\n\n===Chapter IV===\nYou'll need combat equipment to defeat several Tortured Gorillas.[[File:Airship above stronghold.png|thumb|220px|Glough's airship hovering directly above the Gnome Stronghold.]]\nReport to [[King Narnode Shareen]] that the [[Gnome Stronghold]] will be attacked by the airship. Recruit [[Nieve]] for help in defending. Tortured gorillas will appear throughout the Stronghold by simply walking around with Nieve in tow. Kill four of them (they can be safespotted using various trees and scenery in the Stronghold), and return to the bank if necessary. If Nieve disappears at any time, she will be outside the Grand Tree. If you cannot find her there, logging out and then logging back in will return her. You can also hit the \"Call follower\" button in the bottom of the [[Worn Equipment]] interface.\n\n[[File:Glough's crashed airship.png|thumb|220px|The remains of Glough's airship after it crash lands just north of the stronghold.]]\n\nGo back and talk to the king. After that, head north-west of the [[Grand Tree]], and talk to [[Garkor]]. He is located by the [[swamp toad]] and [[king worm]] swamp and the [[tortoise]] enclosure. Go through the crash site and enter the [[Crash Site Cavern]]. There are four more Tortured gorillas outside; pray magic or range, and run past them.\n\nPrepare to fight two [[Tortured gorilla|tortured]] and two [[demonic gorilla]]s. After the cutscene ends, the tortured gorillas will move in and attack; these are slightly stronger than the ones you fought outside and can use multiple [[Combat styles]]. When you kill one of the tortured gorillas, a demonic gorilla will jump down into the fight. The demonic gorillas are far stronger, boasting more health and damage. Most notable is their ability to use [[protection prayer]]s which act similarly to the player's prayers in a [[PvM]] situation (Player vs. Monster); however, [[Verac's set]] '''will not''' hit through their Protect from Melee, so you '''must''' bring two forms of [[combat]] if you kill them normally.\n\n:<span style=\"color:red\">'''Warning:'''</span> Like the [[Kruk]] fight, this area is instanced. Do not bring items you are not willing to lose. If you die in this instance, Nieve will be waiting outside the Grand Tree upon your return.\n\nThe demonic gorillas have all three attack styles. Their white 'throwing' attack is [[Ranged]], green is [[Magic]], and fighting melee is [[Melee]]. Protect accordingly! It is also possible to let Nieve kill all four gorillas for you. Wait for her to start attacking one of the Gorillas then run out of the room and hide behind the pile of rocks. For the demonic gorillas, ensure that they are not using [[Protect from Melee]]; if they are, keep attacking them with magic or range until they change prayers so Nieve can hit them. '''Nieve will not attack the gorillas if you use \"call follower\"; it will take Nieve a bit of time to [[aggro]] the gorillas if you end the cutscene early\u2014let the cutscene end to one of the gorillas attacking you.'''\n\n:'''Note:''' If you are on a black demon slayer task, the demonic gorillas count as on task kills and a slayer helmet may be used.\n\n:'''For Struggling Players:''' If you are having difficulty killing all the gorillas, simply kill both the tortured gorillas that appear; then, leave the room and hide in such a way that the demonic gorillas get stuck behind the wall. '''You MUST tank a few hits from a gorilla in order for Nieve to attack as she will only attack the last monster you were in combat with.''' For example, after you've killed one or both of the tortured gorillas, [[tank]] a few hits from Demonic Gorilla 1 so that Nieve knows which one to attack; then, hide and let her finish off that specific gorilla. Repeat these exact steps for the second demonic gorilla. If they are praying Protect from Melee, use ranged or magical attacks until they switch to [[Protect from Missiles]] or [[Protect from Magic|Magic]], and then hide again.\n\n===Chapter V===\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - Nieve dies.png|thumb|220px|Nieve is killed by a collapsing boulder after Glough's transformation.]]\nAfter defeating Glough's demonic gorillas, he will drink his own mutagen, transforming himself into an abomination. Nieve will attempt to stop him, but gets knocked back to the wall, causing a boulder to fall and crush her, killing her instantly, and then retreating. Players will now have to defeat Glough; it is recommended to return to a bank and restock on supplies, as the fight will prove to be challenging even to the most experienced player.\n\nThe player will need to fight Glough in three separate chambers, which he goes to when his health falls.\n\n'''Note:''' If the player leaves the chamber through [[teleportation]], [[death]] or through the exit at any point during the fight with [[Glough]], all progress is reset back to the first phase. For this reason, it is suggested to read this entire section before proceeding. <span style=\"color:red\">Like the demonic gorilla fight, this section is instanced so '''do not''' bring items you do not want to lose.</span>\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - Glough phase 1 safespot.png|thumb|220px|A safespot available to use in the first phase.]]\nIn the first room, Glough attacks using [[Melee]] and can be attacked safely from the hallway using [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]. Once Glough falls to 75% of his hitpoints, he goes into the second room.\n\nIn the second room, Glough uses ranged attacks as well as melee, stomping the ground and dealing up to 30+ damage. It is possible, but difficult, to safespot him by using a weapon that has an [[attack range]] of 10 squares (In order of preference as they may be available: [[Dark bow]], [[Magic comp bow]], [[Crystal bow]], or [[Magic longbow]]. Notably, the Magic comp bow still has an attack range of 10 squares on 'Rapid' and can double-hit Glough on his third phase if you are attempting to safespot him). To do this, you will have to lure him to and then stand exactly one square out of his attack range, which is about halfway through the room where he went for the first phase, one square east of the first black rock on the southern wall. It is suggested to activate '''[[Protect from Missiles]]''' as this reduces his damage a bit; but he can still hit up to 21 damage with each attack. Lure Glough out of the second room and back into the first, hugging the northern parts of the wall. When you lure Glough far enough, he will not do anything, allowing you to easily hit him. Once he falls at 50% of his hitpoints, he will walk into the final room.\n\n''It is possible, but requires great skill, timing, and good connection, to kill him in his third phase without taking any damage at all with a [[Attack range|10 square-range weapon]] (see #2 below).''\n\nIn the third and final room, Glough will now be able to attack the player using both melee and magic attacks. Glough's melee attack can send you flying backwards and dealing up to '''66 damage''' as a result. For this reason, it is recommended that players keep their health at 80+ to avoid dying as a result of this attack. '''[[Protect from Melee]]''' is highly suggested if using melee equipment to attack him. Glough will only teleport you after he is damaged. [[Ring of recoil|Rings of recoil]] are suggested, especially if attempting to partially safespot him as detailed below. Therefore, it is recommended to keep [[Auto-Retaliate]] disabled and only attack Glough when the player is not in danger of dying as you are unable to eat during, and shortly after being teleported.\n[[File:Battle with Glough.png|thumb|280px|left|Glough drags the player towards him during the final phase of the fight.]]\n\nGlough's magic attack drags the player within distance of his melee attack and deals a large amount of damage. However, it may be exploited to only allow for damage from his magic attack. To do this, use a strong [[ranged weapon]] such as the [[toxic blowpipe]], stand one square west of Glough, and attack. Whenever he teleports you to him using his magic attack, quickly return to the square just west of him and continue attacking him. '''[[Protect from Magic]]''' is highly recommended if using ranged or magic to kill Glough, as his 'teleport deals very high magic-based damage. His damage seems to be roughly halved using the correct prayer. If using this strategy, it is advisable to bring combo foods (e.g. a 'main' food, [[Shark|sharks]] or [[Tuna potato|tuna potatoes]], with [[Pineapple pizza|pineapple pizzas]] and/or brews+restores and/or Karambwans) more one-click foods (e.g. [[tuna potato]]es) over a [[Saradomin brew|brew]]/[[Super restore|restore]] method, as the tick for you to move one square away and use your potions is not enough to counteract his damage. It is also possible, albeit difficult, to eat a karambwan, a high healing food and a potion all in one tick.\n\nAnother technique to use is when Glough teleports you to him, '''Protect from Melee''' and use melee attacks. When Glough pushes you away, '''Protect from Missiles''' and use ranged attacks. The toxic blowpipe and [[whip]] are great weapon choices. Also a [[Dragon halberd|dragon]] or [[crystal halberd]] works wonderfully to chunk Glough's health.\n\nIt is possible to partially safespot Glough on his final form, preferably with a [[Dark bow]] because of its double attack. Interestingly, the [[Magic comp bow]] will also shoot twice if using this method (#1 below); the second time immediately after being teleported, even while spam clicking away from Glough. Safespotting him, especially with method #2, requires great timing and experience with Runescape's .6 tick system. Glough has an [[attack range]] of 11 squares and an aggression range seemingly between 14-18 squares (it is difficult to tell). There are two ways to go about doing this. Either way, set up [[quick prayers]] for [[Protect from Magic|protection from Magic]] and [[Eagle Eye]].\n# Turn on quick prayers and then attack him. He will draw you (teleport) to him. If you want or need to conserve prayer, switch it off mid-'flight.' After (or during, it doesn't make a difference) being teleported, '''very quickly''' (spam click on the minimap) run back at least 11 squares (1 square north of the small black boulder).\n# Similar to flinching, you can continuously run between the previous chamber and the hallway to cancel Glough's aggression. You will have to '''WALK''' while shooting at him (otherwise you will run an extra square), and then '''hold CTRL to run''' back north out of his range without having to enable run. The first few times you do this before 'getting the hang of it,' you should use the quick prayer set up just in case he teleports you, or he could hit upwards of 60 damage. He can be killed very slowly but relatively safely using this method. ''If you are using magic, cast your spell out of the spell book, '''DO NOT use autocast''', as you will spend a tick standing around before actually using the spell.''\n# Running or walking back has little impact on this method.\u00a0Using a blowpipe, you can land 2 hits on glough and eat before he draws you back in with his magic attack.\u00a0This allows you to do a constant barrage of attacks without having to worry about your health. Although it is recommended to use a blowpipe, a crossbow will work as well, only you will will be able to a: land 1 hit with a healing method, or b: land 2 hits without a healing method. If you are already at your maximum hitpoints, you can revert to more damage dealing methods such as a dark bow in place of eating as well.\nStart the battle by attacking Glough in his first room, then running out into the room you entered through. Glough will get stuck between the passageway and you can safely attack him down to 75% health while taking no damage. Protection prayers are '''not''' need for this stage of the fight as Glough only uses melee.\n[[File:Glough Safespot 1.png|thumb|220x220px|The safe spot for Glough's second phase.]]\nFor the second phase, run in and attack Glough. He will attack with a range attack, but protection prayers '''do not''' affect this attack. Run back into the first room Glough was in and go behind the grey rock. As long as you're behind the line parallel to the rock, Glough can't hit you. From here you can safely attack Glough down to 50% health. Make sure you're using [[Long range]] if using a Longbow. \n[[File:Glough Safe Spot.gif|thumb|220x220px|The safe spot technique for Glough's third phase.]]\nFor the last phase, you must first run up to the grey rock in the passage near Glough. Be careful not to go past the rock. Set your quick prayers to Protect from Magic and [[Eagle Eye]] or [[Rigour]] if you have them. Turn them on, attack Glough, and right when you start the attack animation, spam click behind the grey rock on the [[Mini map]]. Then move right behind the grey rock again, restore [[Hitpoints]] and [[Prayer]] if needed, and repeat until Glough is defeated.\n[[File:Monkey Madness II - ending cutscene.png|thumb|250px|Meeting with Awowogei and Narnode to negotiate peace.]]\n\n:'''Note:''' If you and Glough die at the same time, '''you will''' have to repeat the entire fight again.\n\nOnce Glough falls to zero health, the chambers begin to collapse. You will automatically be teleported outside the cavern before being instructed to report back to [[King Narnode]]. Talk to [[Zooknock]] who is waiting for you, and he will teleport you to the king. A cutscene will ensue where [[Awowogei]] will negotiate a peace treaty with King Narnode Shareen.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Monkey Madness II\n|image = [[File:Monkey Madness II reward scroll.png|center]]\n|qp = 4\n|rewards =\n*{{Skill clickpic|Slayer|25,000}} [[Slayer]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Agility|20,000}} [[Agility]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Thieving|15,000}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Hunter|15,000}} [[Hunter]] experience\n*Access to the [[Crash Site Cavern]]\n*The ability to communicate with monkeys in [[Ape Atoll]] without the [[M'speak amulet]].\n*All NPCs on the surface of [[Ape Atoll]] will be non-aggressive without requiring the use of [[Monkey greegree]]s.\n*Access to [[Ape Atoll]] bank and [[Oobapohk's Javelin Store]].\n*Access to new [[glider]] spot directly to Ape Atoll.\n*2x 50,000 [[experience]] rewards from [[Duke]] in your choice of [[Magic]], [[Ranged]], [[Attack]], [[Defence]], [[Strength]] or [[Hitpoints]].

The guard says you are not welcome and does not allow you to pass. Just a bit to the left is another, narrow path. Follow it, and use your [[rope]] on the boulder that says \"push boulder\" and you will automatically climb down. \n\n===Hamal's daughter===\n[[File:Hamal the Chieftain chathead.png|left]]\nFollow the path into the village, enter the longhouse to the east, and speak to [[Hamal the Chieftain]] by asking, ''\"Why is everyone so hostile?\"'', to begin the quest. Speaking of his tribe, Hamal tells you that they are citizens of [[Rellekka]], although due to differences they have moved out to become closer to nature, disagreeing with the [[Fremennik]] tradition of choosing their tools over skill. The chieftain tells you about his missing daughter and after much arguing against \"employing\" an outerlander, he eventually allows you to search for her. From this point on, you can enter the camp by climbing over the rockslide.\n\nHead south of Hamal's house, and take some [[mud]] from the bubbling mud pond.\n\nIf you did not bring a staff, go north of Hamal's house to [[Jokul]]'s place and pick up the [[pole]].\n\n===Crisis===\nJust north of the [[mountain goat]]s is a path leading west. Follow it until you reach a tall tree. Use the [[mud]] you gathered on the tall tree to prevent yourself from slipping.\n[[File:Climbing the tree.png|thumb|220px|Climbing the tall tree to gain access to the island.]]\nClimb the tall tree, crawl along its branch, and jump down to the little island. Use your [[pole]] or [[staff]] on the clump of rocks to pole-vault over them, and then use the [[plank]] to cross the flat stone. On one of the bubbles rising from the pool, select \"Listen-to Shining pool\". \n\nYou hear the voice of the spirit of the chieftain's daughter [[Asleif Hamalsdotter]], who is dead. She asks you to make peace between her tribe and [[Rellekka]] and to also find a new food source for the camp. Agree to help her. To return to shore, use a plank on the flat stone. You can do her two tasks in either order.\n:'''Note:''' Both tasks can be started at the same time. This reduces going back to the [[Mountain Camp]] multiple times. Plan it out accordingly.\n\n===Making peace===\n[[File:Svidi's roaming area map.png|thumb|220px|Svidi's roaming area.]]\nReturn to the [[Mountain Camp]], and talk to [[Hamal the Chieftain]]. Ask about the people of [[Rellekka]], and he tells you that he sent a villager named [[Svidi]] to initiate a simple trade route, but he hasn't yet returned. Head to the rockslide that first blocked your entrance to the Mountain Camp. Climb over it, and go into the woods west of the rockslide. Locate and speak with Svidi.\n:'''Note:''' Make sure to choose the option \"Can't I persuade you to go in there somehow?\", as the other option will cause him to walk off and you will have to find him again.\n\nHe will tell you he's afraid of the [[Fremennik]] in Rellekka and thinks that they might kill him. Offer to help him enter Rellekka and he agrees if you can secure a promise from the chieftain that he will be safe.\n\nHead to Rellekka, and talk to [[Brundt the Chieftain]] in the longhall. He will give you a [[safety guarantee]], promising not to hurt Svidi if you can retrieve a relic - an ancient rock - that the Mountain Camp tribe stole from Rellekka long ago.\n[[File:Mining Ancient Rock.png|thumb|220px|A player mining the Ancient Rock.]]\nReturn to the Mountain Camp, and enter the large tent southwest of Hamal the Chieftain. If you want, you can first talk to Hamal, but he refuses to let you have the rock. Use your [[pickaxe]] on the Ancient Rock located in the southern tent to get [[half a rock]]. Take this back to Rellekka, and talk to Brundt the Chieftain, who will agree to share the rock and give you the guarantee of safe passage. Take the guarantee to Svidi to initiate peace talks between the two tribes.\n\n===Finding food===\n'''<u>Note that you must have talked to Jokul before being able to pick the fruit.</u>'''\n\nReturn again to the [[Mountain Camp]], and speak with [[Hamal the Chieftain|Hamal]], and then talk to [[Jokul]], who is in the tent north of Hamal, looking after his [[mountain goat]]s. He thinks the members of the Mountain Camp could survive if the seed of a [[White pearl]] fruit, a hardy plant which can grow anywhere, were planted in the area.\n[[File:Thornybushonwwm.png|thumb|220px|A thorny bush, just south of the [[gnome glider]] on the peak of [[White Wolf Mountain]].]]\nTravel to the peak of [[White Wolf Mountain]] and look for thorny bushes near the [[gnome glider]]. If you have completed [[The Grand Tree]] [[quest]], you may use a [[ring of dueling]] to teleport to the [[Duel Arena]] which is near a gnome glider. Head west from the Duel Arena to the glider, then fly to the mountains. Put on your [[gloves]] (4 damage will be inflicted if not wearing any, and you won't get the fruit seed), pick a [[White pearl]] fruit off the thorny bushes and eat it. You will automatically spit out the [[White pearl seed]]. \n\nGive the White pearl seed to Hamal the Chieftain, who accepts your solution for feeding the tribe.\n\n===The Kendal===\n[[File:The Kendals Cave.png|thumb|220px|[[The Kendal]]'s cave.]]\nAfter you've completed both tasks, go back to the shining pool and speak to [[Asleif Hamalsdotter|Asleif]] again (make sure to pole vault, and use your [[plank]] on the flat stone). She asks you to convince her father that she is really dead. She was attacked by a creature ([[the Kendal]]) and dragged off nearby to the north where she was killed. Leave the island and head to the north side of the pool (alternatively, cross the gap without using the plank; you'll end up on the north side). Follow the path east to a cave blocked by dead trees. Chop down the ones that block your path with an [[axe]] until you reach a cave entrance (if you face problems chopping down the trees, stand to the west side of the first tree when chopping it down to walk over the stump).\n\nEnter the cave and make your way to the large cavern. You find the Kendal as well as numerous corpses near a central pillar. Talk to the Kendal, and when it asks who you are, say, \"It's just me, no one special\". The Kendal tells you that it is the god of the northern lands.\n[[File:The Kendal safe spot.png|thumb|220px|The [[safespot]] for [[the Kendal]].]]\nSay that he actually looks like a man in a bearsuit, to which he finally admits. After you blow his cover, he also confesses to killing Asleif more than ten years ago. Humbly request her remains, to which he refuses as he cannot let anyone know his true identity. Threaten to kill him, and he'll attack you. He has 50 [[hitpoints]] and a [[combat level]] of 70, and all damage can be blocked if you use the [[Protect from Melee]] [[Prayer]]. If you are using [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]], you can find a [[safespot]] around the skeletons to attack him.\n\nOnce he dies, a [[Bearhead]] mask will appear in your [[inventory]]. Take\u00a0Asleif's corpse, which lies in the southeastern corner of the pillars ([[corpse of woman]]),\u00a0and exit the cave. Cut your way back out of the dead trees and head back to [[Hamal the Chieftain]]. Tell him what you learned and show him his daughter's corpse.\n\nHe asks you to give her a proper burial by building a grave\u00a0on the island at the centre of the pool topped with\u00a0a cairn, symbolising the longboats used to cross the seas, and some of her possessions. He tells you perhaps [[Ragnar]] has one of her possessions for you to use. Gather five [[muddy rock]]s from around the camp. They [[Spawning|respawn]] quickly, so you can just stand on one until you have all five. See the map on the top for locations.\n[[File:Creating burial cairn.png|thumb|220px|A player creating the burial cairn for Asleif.]]\nFollow the path up to Ragnar (he is just past the tall tree), and speak with him. He gives you [[Asleif's necklace]], which he had intended to give her as a gift.

During the quest, you are given access to [[Lletya]], the hideout of the rebel elves, and meet with your old ally [[Arianwyn]]. The first half of a two-part quest about stopping the [[mourner]]s, it revolves around their plans in [[West Ardougne]].\n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = In the Isafdar Woods, where the Roving Elves are (outside Tyras Camp and in the southeast corner of the woods).

Once there, talk to [[Arianwyn]]. He will tell you that the [[Mourner]]s in [[West Ardougne]] are really elves from the capital city, and it's your job to uncover their evil plot. He will also tell you about the elves crossing the overpass of [[Arandar]]. You'll also get a [[teleport crystal]] that teleports you to Lletya four times ''(you can pay Eluned to recharge it after you've used it up)'', and you'll be able to enter and exit the city at will by passing some strange looking trees in the south-east area of the forest ''(one of the spawn points for the Roving Elves)''.\n\nAt this point, it's recommended you leave using a necklace of passage, however, If you try to enter Prifddinas from the front gate, the guard will tell you no humans may enter while the Mourners are at large, so you need to get in from the side entrance. \n\nGo to the entrance of Arandar (the mountain entrance on the map that leads into the side of Prifddinas) using a Spirit Tree to Gnome Stronghold or a Necklace of Passage to the Outpost and kill a level 11 Mourner near the gate. Before the battle, it will throw a potion at you that will reduce all of your [[Combat]] stats including [[Hitpoints]] to 20. You should still be able to kill it if you have a good weapon. It should also be noted that you can kill the mourner in one hit to avoid fighting it with reduced stats, but the stat reduction will still occur. The Mourner will not spawn if your health is below 20 as you approach the gate. After it dies, you'll get a [[gas mask]], a [[bloody mourner top]], damaged [[mourner trousers]], [[mourner boots]], [[mourner gloves]], a [[mourner cloak]], and a [[mourner letter]]. You will need all of these items. As you have ripped the trousers and got the top all bloody, you will need to repair and clean them before they can be worn.\n\n''You may now want to go to the [[Clan Wars]] FFA portal using a [[ring of dueling]] to restore your stats and take out your [[bucket of water]] from the bank/chest.''\n\n=== Repairing the mourner gear ===\n'''''Items needed:''' A [[bucket of water]], 2 pieces of [[silk]], [[bear fur]]''.\n\n==== Top ====\nTo remove the blood stains from the [[bloody mourner top|top]], go to [[Taverley]]. Talk to [[Tegid]], who is doing his laundry by the lake. He will tell you about his [[Tegid's soap|special soap]], which he won't let you have. Steal it from his laundry basket (level 50 [[Thieving]] required). With that and a [[bucket of water]], wash the blood stains out. You can now wear the [[mourner top]].\n\n==== Trousers ====\nTo fix the [[Mourner trousers|trousers]], go back to [[Lletya]], and talk to the elven seamstress ([[Oronwen]]). Give her two [[silk]] and one [[bear fur]], followed by the damaged trousers (use each item on her). She will mend them and give them back to you.\n\n:At any point in the quest when a character asks you to \"wait a minute\" or some variant thereof, you can just relog to avoid waiting.\n\nBuy [[dyes]] while you're in town. You only need one of each (red, yellow, green, and blue), but you could buy more dyes from her shop, just in case you miss your target sheep while firing with the Gnome device.\n\n=== Infiltrating the Mourner HQ ===\n'''''Items needed:''' [[Mourner gear]], [[mourner letter]], a [[feather]], [[leather]], [[magic logs]] and [[toad crunchies]]''\n\nWear the [[mourner gear]], take the [[mourner letter]], [[feather]], [[soft leather]], [[magic logs]] and [[toad crunchies]]. Take off all of your other items, and go to the [[Mourner HQ]] in [[West Ardougne]] that you went to during the [[Biohazard]] quest. It is the most northeastern building in West Ardougne. You can now access the basement, where you'll find level 108 [[Mourner]]s and the real [[head mourner]]. Talk to the head mourner and show him your letter. Welcome to the Death Guard!\n\n===The device===\nHe will tell you that the Mourners' job is to keep people believing in the plague. Recently, they [[Sheep Herder|dyed four of Farmer Brumty's sheep]] with a gnomic [[Fixed device|device]]. However, the colour is starting to vanish and they need redyeing. Normally, they use a gnomic device, but it has broken down and the gnome won't tell them how to repair it, and he'll give you the [[broken device]]. Go into the torture room next door, using your [[tarnished key]], and talk to the [[Gnome (Mourner Headquarters)|gnome]] on the rack.\n\nHe will eventually tell you that he hates having his feet tickled and loves [[toad crunchies]]. Make sure you answer those two things at the end of the conversation, otherwise it won't work. Do not give him the crunchies first, or else he will eat them and you will need to get some more! Use your [[feather]] on him to tickle his feet; then, do it again and bribe him with the crunchies. After you get him off the rack (talk to him once more, then use the \"release\" option; the mourner guard in the room will protest at first, but eventually he'll allow you to release the gnome), he will ask you for a piece of [[soft leather]] and a [[magic log]]. He will use those to repair [[fixed device|the device]], which looks like a bazooka.\n\n===Sheep===\n'''''Items needed:''' [[Fixed device]], [[red dye]], [[blue dye]], [[yellow dye]], [[green dye]], [[ogre bellows]].''[[File:Fixed device aim.png|thumb|200px|The aim and fire interface.]]\nYou now need some ammunition. Any swamp toad location will do, but the easiest way to do this is to use fairy ring {{Fairycode|BKP}}, as some swamp toads are immediately northeast of this location. Alternatively, use a [[ring of dueling]] to teleport to [[Castle Wars]] and run south along the coastline, then west. Near the swamps, you can find toads. Use each of the dyes on the empty bellows, and use the dyed bellows on a toad to get a toad of each colour.  \n\nGo north of [[Ardougne]] to the coloured sheep ''(examine them to find out their colour).''  [[File:Sheep Herder and Mourning's Ends I map.png|thumb|200px]]\nUse the coloured toads on the launcher to load it. After loading the toads, go to [[Combat Options]] (crossed swords tab). Choose \"Aim and Fire\". Find one, aim at it with its respective colour , and press FIRE!  \n\nSuccessfully firing at one of the sheep will coat the entire herd. \n\n:If you are having trouble hitting the sheep, switching from Resizeable Mode to Fixed Mode may solve any issues you encounter.\n\n===Poisoning food supply===\n'''''Items needed:''' [[Mourner gear]], [[Rotten apple]], [[barrel of naphtha]]''\n\nAfter you've redyed all four, return to the [[head mourner]]. He will tell you that someone [[Biohazard|poisoned their stew]] recently, causing them to get plague-like symptoms. He will tell you that he wants some citizens to get a non-lethal version of the plague. You need to make the poison and poison two out of three food sources.\n\nTake a [[rotten apple]] near the [[Mourner HQ]] (just north-west); then, go to [[Elena]] (her house is in the north-west in [[East Ardougne]], the nearest to the log balance shortcut). She will tell you how to make the poison after you tell her the entire plague city storyline and show her the rotten apple (do not eat the apple!). She will also give you a [[sieve]].\n[[File:Mashing apples.png|thumb|200px|Mashing the rotten apples.]]\nUsing your Necklace of Passage, teleport to Jorral's Outpost. Directly Northeast, is the Apple Orchard. Pick up a Barrel (Located right next to the rotten apple piles) and use it on the rotten apple pile; then, use the barrel of [[rotten apples]] on the [[Apple Barrel]]. You will mash them up, receiving an [[apple barrel]].\n\nIf you already have a [[barrel of naphtha]], skip to [[#Mixing the naphtha with the apples|\u00a7 Mixing the naphtha with the apples]].\n[[File:Coal tar spot.png|thumb|left|200px|The location to obtain the coal-tar.]]\nYou now need to add a solvent to make it nonlethal and undetectable. Take another barrel from the apple orchard or [[Tyras Camp]], and use it on the coal tar swamp in the elf kingdom to get a barrel of coal tar (see exact location on the left). Then, get about 10 - 15 regular [[coal]] and go to the [[Chemist]]'s house in [[Rimmington]].\n\nA simple step-by-step guide for this part is:\n#Rotate the tar regulator clockwise twice to make the tar flow at it's maximum. The 'pressure' indicator on the left should go up.\n#When the pressure enters the green region, rotate the pressure valve clockwise once to let out some pressure. This should stall the pressure indicator.\n#Start adding coal. This raises the 'heat' indicator on the right. If it is below the green region, add more coal. If it is above, do not add coal until it gets lower.\n#If the heat reading reaches the dark orange portion, you have spoiled your compound and must start again; however, this can be done with the same barrel of tar.\n#If you run out of coal, your progress will be saved. This means you do not have to re-set the pressure or re-add coal to it.\n\nThe bar on the bottom should start turning green. When it is full, stop adding coal and close the window to replace your empty barrel with a barrel of naphtha.\n\n====Mixing the naphtha with the apples====\nUse the [[barrel of naphtha]] on the [[apple barrel]] to get a [[naphtha apple mix]]; then, use your [[sieve]] on it to obtain a barrel of [[toxic naphtha]]. Use it on a range, not a fire. (There is one in the south-west part of the main square in [[Ardougne]]. Alternatively, the range in the Mourner HQ could be used.)\n\nYou will then get two [[toxic powder]] heaps. Use these on two of the grain sacks in [[West Ardougne]], either in the general store in the south-west corner of the city, the church, or inside the office north of the manhole. Go back to the [[head mourner]]. He'll tell you that their plan is to go into the mountains, and use the plague victims as slaves to help them dig into a temple that will make it easier to resurrect a Dark Lord.\n\n'''Congratulations!

He will tell you to go and stop the [[mourner]]s from excavating under [[West Ardougne]], and that you need a key from the [[head mourner]] to enter the excavation site.\n:'''Note:''' You will not start the quest until you get the new key from the head mourner.\n\nNext, put on your full [[mourner gear]] and remove all of your other worn items (rings and ammunition/blessings are allowed). Bring a [[teleport crystal]], and some food if you have low [[Defence]] or do not have 43 [[Prayer]] for [[Protect from Melee]]. Also, bring along a [[chisel]]. Go to the basement of the [[Mourner HQ]] in Ardougne, and talk to the head mourner.\n\nHe will give you a [[new key]] to the nearby tunnels that they dug to the [[Temple of Light]]. He will ask you to find the digging team, a group of slaves and mourners that have high enough [[Slayer]] skills to defeat the [[Dark Beast|beasts]] in the area. Leave the head mourner's room and open the door on the west wall. Go into the tunnel. You will see level 182 [[Dark beast]]s. The beasts require a Slayer level of 90 in order to be harmed, and use both melee and magic - however, they only use melee unless you cannot reach them or attack them first.\n\n'''Note:''' For [[ironmen]] with 90 Slayer, they can kill the dark beasts for the [[death talisman]], which will save a lot of time further on in the quest.\n\nRun past them (to the west, then take the southwestern turn) to reach the temple entrance. They hit hard; it would be a good idea to use Protect from Melee whilst running past. You'll see a cutscene; shortly thereafter, you may be attacked by level 73 [[Shadow]]s. Search the corpses of the digging team to get [[Edern's Journal]] and a [[colour wheel]]. The wheel is unnecessary for the quest and can be dropped.\n\nRead the journal, from there, go west and climb up the stairs. Go south, then climb up the ladder on the southern wall. Go north then take the stairs to your northwest down, then back up. Run as much east as is possible, then south to the crystal. Use a chisel on it to break off a [[Blackened crystal|piece]]. Teleport to Lletya, and go back to Arianwyn.\n[[File:Black Crystal.png|thumb|220px|The broken, blackened crystals.]]\nHe will summon [[Eluned]], who will enchant the black crystal in your inventory into a [[newly made crystal]] (note: use the blackened crystal on Eluned). It will be used at the end of the quest. Talk to Arianwyn again; then, you will need to prepare for a long and potentially frustrating puzzle.\n\n===The light puzzles===\n'''''Items required:'''\u00a0Full [[mourner gear]], the [[new key]], [[rope]]. If you're planning to complete the puzzles in a single trip, bring a [[death talisman]]/[[death tiara]] and the [[newly made crystal]] too.''<br />'''''Recommended equipment:''' [[Weight-reducing clothing]], high [[Prayer items|Prayer bonus]] gear''<br />'''''Recommended items:''' [[Prayer potion]]s, [[stamina potion]]s, [[food]], [[summer pie]]s/[[agility potion]]s''\n\nIf you want to attempt the puzzle in one trip, bring the [[Mourner gear|mourner clothing]], the [[new key]], the [[Newly made crystal|crystal]], and a death talisman. As you progress through the puzzle you will need an increasing number of inventory spaces free in order to hold the mirrors and crystals, which you will have naturally as you consume prayer potions and food. You will need 4 inventory spaces for the first steps of the puzzle, increasing to 13 inventory spaces open for the last step of the puzzle. Feel free to bank between every major section in the puzzle as the mirrors and crystals will be in the same positions you've left them if you decide to teleport out. However, you cannot bank the mirrors and crystals received in the temple, so prepare to complete each section from the beginning to the end before doing anything else.\n\nIt is highly recommended to bring some of the following: [[Prayer]]-boosting equipment, [[super energy potion]]s, [[weight-reducing gear]], [[prayer potions]], [[Agility]] boosts, and [[food]]. If you find that prayer potions are too expensive, bring good [[armour]] and [[defence potion]]s instead. It is much, much more convenient to buy a [[death talisman]]/[[Death tiara|tiara]] from the [[Grand Exchange]], and to bring it if you have one. Otherwise, you will have to give an [[NPC]] a long list of items (see below) to get a death talisman. The death talisman is not consumed during the quest, and players can decide what to do with it after its role is finished.\n\n====Map of the temple====\n<imagemap>\nFile:Temple of Light map.png|600px|centre\ndesc none\n\n# Legend\nrect 308 15 419 36 [[Temple of Light]]\nrect 10 267 80 297 [[Underground Pass (dungeon)]]\n\nrect 401 159 476 177 [[Thorgel]]\nrect 399 179 499 195 [[Death altar]]\nrect 400 214 529 230 [[Hand mirror]]\nrect 400 231 582 250 [[Cyan crystal]]\nrect 400 251 693 267 [[Fractured crystal]]\nrect 401 269 577 285 [[Blue crystal]]\nrect 401 287 510 304 [[Black crystal]]\n\n# Map\ncircle 112 227 6 [[Thorgel]]\npoly 104 232 110 245 97 245 [[Death altar]]\nrect 164 154 177 167 [[Fractured crystal]]\nrect 294 305 307 318 [[Fractured crystal]]\nrect 335 433 348 446 [[Hand mirror]]\nrect 342 655 352 667 [[Cyan crystal]]\npoly 463 641 471 640 472 649 477 650 477 654 461 654 [[Blue crystal]]\npoly 668 540 673 536 676 532 678 538 684 540 679 544 676 549 672 544 [[Black crystal]]\n</imagemap>\n\n===Blue door===\n[[File:Crystal_collector.png|thumb|The crystal collector is just east up the main stairs on the wall.]]\nGo back to the [[Temple of Light]].

If done correctly, you should see a little beam of light flowing up.\n*Go back upstairs to the middle floor, go to the north side of the temple and find the pillar with a little beam of light flowing up. Put the [[yellow crystal]] in that pillar to dye the light yellow.\n*There is a ladder on the north wall right next to this pillar. Go up the ladder to the top floor. Put a mirror in the pillar and reflect the light west. It should pass through a pillar that has a magenta crystal in it.

Just before you reach the south wall, go up the stairs on the western wall. Then, go all the way to the north-west corner. Put a mirror in this pillar and reflect the light south.\n*Follow the beam to the south-west corner, and add a mirror. Reflect the light down to the floor below. The fat portion of the crystal should be on top during the rotation screen.\n*Return to the stairs that brought you to this floor (next to the handholds). Descend the stairs, and travel west around them to a circular, dead-end room which you may enter by climbing over a low wall. Climb over the low wall and enter the circular room, where you will see a large hole in the floor with a rock directly beside it. Use your [[rope]] on the rock, and climb down. Go south-west, passing through the door to where you may open the chest to get a\u00a0[[blue crystal]].\n'''Don't reset the system! Otherwise, you will have to repeat the previous steps.'''\n[[File:Pillar_of_Light_(Cyan).png|thumb|The pillar is at the north side on the middle floor by a ladder.]]\n*Go to the pillar where you put the yellow crystal in during the last step (north side of the middle floor). Remove the yellow crystal, and replace it with the [[blue crystal]]. You should now see a blue light going up. The mirror you placed above this pillar during the last step will reflect the light west, like before. However, this time, a blue light will be going west.\n*Start to run south. Before you reach the south wall, again go up the western stairs. Then, go as far north as you can, as far west as you can, and all the way to the north-west corner. Rotate the mirror in this pillar to reflect the light down (the bigger side of the mirror should point east).\n*Go to the bottom floor (use the southern stairs down, and then the stairs near the crystal collector, not the room with the rope). In the north-west corner, pass through the yellow door by rotating the mirror south. Go south then east, then go open the chest to get two more mirrors and the first\u00a0[[fractured crystal]].\n*Go back to and use the crystal collector.\n\n===Pink and yellow doors=== \n[[File:Crystal collector.png|thumb|The first pillar with a mirror reflecting the light north.]]\n\nAt this point you should have (10 x mirrors, 1 Fractured crystal, yellow crystal, cyan crystal, and blue crystal)\n\n*The first thing you need to do is '''open the blue door again'''. Follow the [[Mourning's Ends Part II#Blue door|above steps]] to open it. Once you get inside, use your [[blue crystal]] on the pillar, then exit. '''Collect all your [[Hand mirror|mirrors]] and [[yellow crystal]] by walking around and getting them by hand. Do not use the crystal collector! All that should remain is the blue crystal at this point.'''\n*Go back to the first pillar with the light beam shining up and add a mirror. Reflect the light north.\n*Go north to the next pillar. Add a mirror and reflect the light west.\n*Go west to the next pillar, add a mirror, and reflect the light up.\n[[File:Pillar_of_Light_(near_Black_Crystal).png|thumb|The pillar just north-west of the black crystal is the one.]]\n*Go south, climb up the western stairs, and go northeast. Make your way to the pillar that is northeast of the northern stairs/on the other side of the little room near the [[black crystal]]. Add a mirror and reflect the light south.\n*Make your way south to the next pillar. Add your fractured crystal to split the beam into three parts. You will use one of these to open the pink door and the other to open the yellow door.\n\n====Yellow door part 1====\n*From the [[fractured crystal]], follow the beam of light south. Add a [[Hand mirror|mirror]] and reflect the light east.\n*Go east to the south-east corner. Add a mirror and reflect the light down -\u00a0it should show the mirror's big side pointing towards west (not south). Go back to the fractured crystal that split your beam\u00a0into three parts.\n\n====Pink door====\n*From the [[fractured crystal]], go west to the next pillar. Add a [[Hand mirror|mirror]], and reflect the light down (not south). It should show the mirror's big side pointing towards east.\n*Go down to the '''bottom floor''', and find the pillar with a little beam of light coming out (head south, then west from the stairs). You will see that a green crystal has dyed the light green. Add a mirror and reflect the light south.\n[[File:Pillar_of_Light_(SE).png|thumb|The end result of successfully directing the green and the blue beams.]]\n*Go south, add a mirror, and reflect the light east. This will unlock the pink door.\n\n====Yellow door part 2====\n*Go to the south-east corner. Pass through the pink door; then, add a [[Hand mirror|mirror]] to the pillar inside. Reflect the blue light north and pass through the door.\n*Open the chest to get more mirrors and another [[fractured crystal]].\n\n===Cyan and black doors===\nYou now need to open two doors: a new cyan door and a huge black door, using everything you have. Go back to the crystal collector, and pull the lever. Collect all of your items. You do not need the [[cyan crystal]] for the last puzzle. It's easier to destroy it for space and for less confusion.\n*Go west to the first pillar, and put a [[Hand mirror|mirror]] in the pillar. Reflect the light north.\n*Go north to the next pillar, add a mirror, and reflect the light down (wider edge facing south).\n*Go to the bottom floor. Go north, and add a mirror to the pillar with light coming out. Reflect the light west.\n*Go west to the next pillar, and add the [[fractured crystal]] with the bright side on the left and the dark side on the right in order to split the beam.\n*Go south to the next pillar, and add the other fractured crystal to split the beam.\n*You now need to get a red beam, a blue beam, and a green beam of light pointed at the column in the final room. This will make a new clear beam that you can use to enter the black door.\n\n====Green beam====\n*From the second [[fractured crystal]], walk west, put a [[Hand mirror|mirror]], and reflect the light up. This will make it go through the green crystal.\n*Go to the top floor from the southern ladder on the middle floor. Go north and then west one pillar, add a mirror, and reflect it west.\n*The light will then reflect off of a mirror already in the final column and go down. It will now be in the final room pointed at the final pillar.\n\n====Blue beam====\n[[File:Pillar_of_Light_(Fractured_Crystals).png|thumb|The first fractured crystal is on the ground floor north of the stairs, and the second is south of the stairs.]]\n*From the second [[fractured crystal]], which is on the bottom floor south of the stairs, walk east. Add a [[Hand mirror|mirror]] to this pillar and reflect the light up.\n*Go to the top floor. Find the pillar with a little beam of light coming up and add a mirror. It should be directly south of the black crystal. Reflect the light west.\n*Follow the beam of light to the next pillar. Add a mirror and reflect the light north.\n*Follow the beam of light to the next pillar and add a mirror. Reflect the light west.\n*Go west to the next pillar. Add the [[blue crystal]] to dye the beam blue.\n*The blue beam will then reflect down off of a mirror already in the next column. It will now be in the final room, pointed at the final pillar.\n\n====Red beam====\n*From the first [[fractured crystal]], which is on the bottom floor north of the stairs, walk north. Add a [[Hand mirror|mirror]], and reflect the light up.\n*Go to the middle floor, and find the pillar with the beam of light coming up. Add the [[yellow crystal]] to dye the light yellow.\n*Climb up the ladder (the one on the northern wall of where you put the yellow crystal, '''not the one to the south''') to the top floor. Add a mirror to the pillar and reflect the light west. It will go through a purple crystal, where the blue and yellow will cancel each other out, leaving you with a red beam.\n[[File:Temple of Light final pillar.png|thumb|220px|The puzzle has been completed!]]\n*Go back to the middle floor. Go to the south end, climb up the stairs, and make your way to the north-west corner. Add a mirror and reflect the light south.\n*Go south to the next pillar. Add a mirror and reflect the light east. It will now be in the final room, pointed at the final pillar.\n*Go down the stairs in the middle of the top floor; then, go down the next set of stairs. Go through the cyan door. Turn the mirror towards the final pillar to merge it with the other two beams. It will be pointed at the black door. If you didn't bring a [[death talisman]] (or tiara) with you to finish the quest, then: '''When you're ready to leave, make sure to turn the light back towards the entrance door, otherwise to get back in here you will have to either do the whole thing again or go through the Underground Pass to get back.'''\n*Pass through the now white door.\n\n===The death altar===\n'''''Items required:'''\u00a0a [[death talisman]]/[[death tiara]] OR the 50 items below (suggested only for [[Ironmen]] due to the tediousness of this). If you bring the death talisman, take the [[newly made crystal]] too.''\n:''You can skip this whole section if you have already bought/received a [[death talisman]] or [[death tiara]].''\n[[File:Temple of Light death altar.png|thumb|220px|The death altar.]]\nAfter you go through the final door, talk to the dwarf [[Thorgel]]. You will ask each other how you got to the altar, and he will reveal there is a passage from the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] created by him and his companions. You will ask if he knows [[Klank]], after which he will realise you are the one who slew [[Lord Iban|Iban]]. Because of this, he agrees to trade you a [[death talisman]] in return for some supplies.\n\nHe gives you an [[item list]] that tells you what you need to get him. By bringing Thorgel each of the fifty items on the list, you will be able to obtain a death talisman.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n*[[Babydragon bones]]\n*[[Ball of wool]]\n*[[Bronze bar]]\n*[[Bronze med helm]]\n*[[Bucket of milk]]\n*[[Cake tin]]\n*[[Cheese]]\n*[[Chisel]]\n*[[Cooked meat]]\n*[[Egg]]\n*[[Facemask]]\n*[[Fishing rod]]\n*[[Flax]]\n*[[Gold ring]]\n*[[Hammer]]\n*[[Iron axe]]\n*[[Iron nails]]\n*[[Iron pickaxe]]\n*[[Jug of wine]]\n*[[Kebab]]\n*[[Knife]]\n*[[Leather boots]]\n{{Col-2}}\n*[[Leather gloves]]\n*[[Lobster pot]]\n*[[Lockpick]]\n*[[Necklace mould]]\n*[[Needle]]\n*[[Oak logs]]\n*[[Pie dish]]\n*[[Plank]]\n*[[Pot of flour]]\n*[[Potato cactus]]\n*[[Potatoes|Potatoes(10)]] (a sack of potatoes)\n*[[Pure essence]]\n*[[Redberries]]\n*[[Rope]]\n*[[Rotten tomato]]\n*[[Shears]]\n*[[Skull (item)|Skull]]\n*[[Spade]]\n*[[Swamp paste]]\n*[[Thread]]\n*[[Tinderbox]]\n*[[Unicorn horn dust]]\n*[[Vial of water]]\n*[[White apron]]\n*[[White berries]]\n{{Col-2}}\n*One of these three tickets:\n**[[Archery ticket]]\n**[[Agility arena ticket]]\n**[[Castle wars ticket]]\n:''The needed ticket is chosen randomly.''\n*One of these three books:\n**[[Crumbling tome]]\n**[[Slashed book|Slashed]]/[[battered book]]\n**[[Prifddinas' history]] (The Creation of Prifddinas)\n:''The needed book is chosen randomly.''\n:''All of these books can be found in the bookcases in your house.''\n*One of these three keys:\n**[[Jail key]]\n**[[Dusty key]]\n**[[Door key]] (door key for [[Witch's House]] under potted plant not [[Hallowvale]])\n:''The needed key is chosen randomly.''\n{{Col-end}}\nYou can give these items in more than one load. '''WARNING: If you teleport out, make sure you turn the mirror towards the cyan door first!''' Otherwise, you'll lock yourself out and you'll have to go through the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] and enter the tunnel inside the dwarf camp or redo the final puzzle. The entry at the dwarf camp is most easily reached from the [[Lletya]] village, which is fairly close to the elven land entrance to the Underground Pass. Doing the Underground Pass in reverse to get to the dwarf village is a lot easier. The tunnel is located directly south of the main building. It is not marked on the minimap, so it is rather difficult to see.\n\n===The power of death===\n[[File:Temple of Light repowered crystal.png|thumb|220px|The temple's safeguard is now restored.]]\nUse your [[death talisman]] on the [[death altar]] or wear your [[death tiara]], then use the [[newly made crystal]] that [[Eluned]] repaired for you on it to charge it. Exit the death altar, and then exit the final chamber and make your way to the black crystal that you observed at the beginning of the quest. Use this charged crystal on the black crystal. This will stop people from entering the temple for another thousand years! Go back to [[Lletya]], and talk to Arianwyn for your reward.\n\n'''Congratulations!

However, there are plenty of clues to be found as to who the culprit is.\n\n===Starting out===\n[[File:Murder mystery start location.png|thumb|left|The start point of the quest.]]\n[[File:Murder mystery (1).png|thumb|Starting the quest.]]\nFirst, talk to the [[Guard (Sinclair Mansion)|guard]] to activate the quest. Then, enter the house and search the murder scene, which is on the east side of the {{FloorNumber|1}}. Inside will be a [[pungent pot]], which you should collect, along with the [[criminal's dagger]]. Investigate the smashed window to find the [[criminal's thread]].\n[[File:Murder mystery (2).png|thumb|1x1px]]\nGo around to the various bedrooms belonging to the suspects to find a number of silver items, all contained within barrels in each room. (There are four rooms upstairs and two on the {{FloorNumber|1}}.) Look for:\n*[[Anna]]'s [[silver necklace]]\n*[[Bob (Sinclair)|Bob]]'s [[silver cup]]\n*[[Carol]]'s [[silver bottle]]\n*[[David]]'s [[silver book]]\n*[[Elizabeth]]'s [[silver needle]]\n*[[Frank]]'s [[silver pot (Murder Mystery)|silver pot]]\n\nNow, it's time to get your first piece of evidence. Go to the main entrance of the mansion, and go north-east until you reach the [[Sinclair Guard dog|guard dog]] enclosure. Investigate the sturdy wooden gate for more information.\n\nNext, go to the gardener's shed (the small house on the ground level, west side of the outside of the mansion) and investigate the sacks to find [[flypaper]]. Take seven of these.\n[[File:Murder Mystery (3).png|thumb|1x1px]]\n\nGo to the kitchen, and fill your pot with flour. Use it on the criminal's dagger; then, use the dagger on a piece of flypaper to get an [[unknown print]]. Dust each silver item with more flour, and use the flypaper to lift fingerprints from the items; then, compare them to the print of the criminal's dagger you found at the crime scene by using the flypaper pieces on the first flypaper print you got from the dagger.\n\nOnce you've got a match, you can drop all the silver items except for your proof.\n\n'''Note:''' You may want to keep the silver necklace since it is a unique cosmetic item and cannot be obtained after completing the quest. If so, you will need to drop the item before completing the quest and pick it up afterwards. Otherwise, the item is taken from your bank or inventory upon quest completion.\n\nYou'll need more than just that for a conviction, though. Go to the entrance of the mansion, and talk to [[Gossip]], and ask him who he thinks is responsible.\n[[File:Murder Mystery Poison.png|thumb|220x220px|Talking to the Poison Salesman]]\nNext, you need to gather info about the poison. There's a [[Poison Salesman|poison salesman]], who sells it inside of the pub west of the [[bank]] in [[Seers' Village]]. Ask him to whom he sold the poison, and he'll tell you that everyone at the mansion bought some.\n\nGo back to the house and ask the person who had the fingerprints on the criminal's dagger to find out what the poison was used on. Search the item they mention, detailed here: \n[[File:Murder mystery (4).png|thumb|1x1px]]\n* Anna - Compost heap\n* Bob - Beehive in cow pen\n* Frank - Family Crest, east of the front door\n* David - Spider nest, upstairs between the two rooms with three beds each in them\n* Carol - Sinclair mansion drain, west of the front door\n* Elizabeth - The fountain\nYou'll find that the subject was lying and didn't use their poison on what they had said they did.\n\nGo back and talk to a guard and tell him you know who did it. Use the fingerprints of the person that did it on the unknown fingerprint.  Show him the fingerprints, tell him about the poison, and show him the thread from the windowsill, since its colour will be a match to an article of the guilty party's clothing. Case closed!\n\n'''Note: '''The guard will take the evidence from you.

He has heard that [[human]]s can grow [[goutweed]], and wonders if you can help. You should see a short [[cutscene]] with a fellow [[adventurer]] in a cooking pot, and his [[dragon armour]] strewn over the floor. He wants his assistant to learn how to farm, and his assistant is called [[My Arm]]. My Arm is at the back of the room; talk to him, and he will tell you he needs the [[Goutweedy lump|goutweed lump]] from the cooking pot at [[Death Plateau (location)|Death Plateau]]. My Arm will tell you to talk to [[Burntmeat]] who will give you directions for getting to [[Death Plateau (location)|Death Plateau]] (though it is probably quicker to use a [[games necklace]]). There's two ways of getting there, but regardless of which way you choose, you will need the [[climbing boots]]. Be careful, as there are several large aggressive [[mountain troll]]s in this area, so wearing decent [[armour]] is recommended!\n\n====Way 1====\nFollow Burntmeat's instructions. Head north through the door, and go east through another door before proceeding downstairs. You're now down by the jailcells, go all the way south past the two troll guards, and exit the caves. Once you're out, head east and climb over some rocks. The path will split up, head down the southern one and climb over some more rocks (there's a mountain goat down this path). Finally, go east and climb down to Death Plateau.\n\n====Way 2====\nUse a games necklace to [[teleport]] to [[Burthorpe]] with some [[coins]]; travel to the west, and buy some climbing boots off [[Tenzing]] for 12 coins. Then, climb up to [[Death Plateau (location)|Death Plateau]], and use [[Protect from Missiles]] along the way past the [[Soldier (Death Plateau)|injured soldier]].\n\nOnce there, pick up the [[bucket]] in a nearby hut, and search the cooking pot to get the [[Goutweedy lump]]. Travel back to the [[Troll Stronghold]], and talk to [[My Arm]] again. He will take you outside to the roof, where he does his farming. Speak to him again when you're up there, and he will give you a [[farming manual]].\n===Fertiliser===\nYou now need to get three [[bucket]]s of [[Ugthanki dung]], and seven [[supercompost]], if you haven't brought those already.

Simply use the buckets on the dung to collect it.\n\n'''Items needed: '''7 supercompost, 3 Ugthanki dung and a spade.\n\nOnce you have the [[Ugthanki dung]] and 7 buckets of [[supercompost]], head back to [[My Arm]], who is on the roof of the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]].

Find My Arm just east of the [[Jiminua's Jungle Store|general store]] and north of the calquat patch. Talk to him and then head to the village.\n\nGo south to the shop, buy a [[machete]] and an [[antipoison]] potion (if you haven't already gotten 60% favour), go towards the general store, and you should find My Arm again east from the general store. Go southeast and talk to [[Murcaily]], who is found right next to the gate to the [[Hardwood Grove]]. He runs the [[Tai Bwo Wannai Cleanup]] game. He will let you have some hardy goutweed tubers if you get 60% in the cleanup game. Get 60% in the cleanup game.

So, talk to the customs officers and pay the 30 coins to go back to Port Sarim.\n\n===Back at Port Sarim===\n'''''Items required:''' [[White apron]], and a [[Varrock teleport|Varrock]] and [[Falador teleport]] (optional but HIGHLY recommended).''\n\nWhen you get off the ship,\u00a0head over to\u00a0[[Port Sarim#Gerrant's Fishy Business|Gerrant's Fishy Business]]. On the back wall, you should\u00a0find a\u00a0[[white apron]]\u00a0hanging up; take it and equip it.\n\nNext, find the food store in the building just south of the fishing shop. Talk to [[Wydin]] and ask to work for him, and if you have your white apron equipped, he'll agree. Enter the room and search the crate with a [[banana]] on top of it in the back room. You should find your rum. Take it and give it to [[Redbeard Frank]].\n\nFrank will give you a [[Chest key (Pirate's Treasure)|key]] to a chest that is upstairs in the [[Blue Moon Inn]] (don't use lumbridge teleport or you will loose your key, however another can be obtained from frank), in [[Varrock]]. Make sure you pick up the key before you go to Varrock, and near the southern entrance, the Blue Moon Inn should be just to the east. Go upstairs in the bar, and look for a chest in the south-western room. Use the key you got from Frank on the chest to obtain a [[pirate message]]. It will give you a clue to the treasure's location. Be sure to ''read the clue''. Teleport, or travel to [[Falador]].\n\n===Buried treasure===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Spade]], [[pirate message]], and a [[weapon]] (optional but recommended).''\n\nBefore you do the following, get a [[spade]] if you don't already have one.You can also get a spade from the house just south of Falador Park. You can buy spades at [[farming]] stores, and they spawn in a number of locations. The best spawn to retrieve your spade is in a house south-west of [[Falador Park]] that has a house icon on it. Once you have a spade, go to [[Falador]] and look for the park. It is north of the eastern bank. It is very large and cannot be missed.\n[[File:Pirate's Treasure - Buried treasure location.png|thumb|284x284px|Location of the buried treasure.]]\nNow, look for a statue of [[Saradomin]]. Look at where he is pointing. You must remember though, that he is NOT in fact pointing directly at where you should stand. Look at how the configuration of the dirt makes an X. Stand in the middle of the dirt \"X\" and click on your spade to dig.\n\nA [[gardener]] will then start fighting you. Kill him, or run out of the park and then run back in, and then dig again in the same spot to get a casket and complete the quest! (Simply digging up the treasure will complete the quest.) Open the casket for 450 coins, a [[gold ring]], and a cut [[emerald]].\n\n==Reward==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Pirate'ss Treasure\n|image = [[File:Pirate's Treasure reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards =\n*Ability to use the pay-fare option to and from [[Karamja]].\n*Access to [[Casket (Pirate's Treasure)|One-Eyed Hector's Treasure Chest]] (contains a [[gold ring]], an [[emerald]], and 450 gold).\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\n*[[Cabin Fever]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*When the quest was first released, the [[Karamja rum]] were tradeable and the bottles would not break if players tried to teleport. Some players simply bought a whole load of rum and sold it to players doing the quest, allowing them to skip a large part of it. When this was posted on fan forums, a Jagex developer saw it and the problem was soon corrected.\n*If you have completed [[Rum Deal]] prior to starting this quest, you will ask Redbeard Frank if \"Braindead Rum\" will do.

Additionally, you can buy dwellberries\u00a0from\u00a0[[Heckel Funch]]\u00a0in the [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]] on the {{FloorNumber|2}} of the [[Grand Tree]] on the east side or even grow them yourself with level 36\u00a0[[Farming]].\n*[[Rope]] can easily be bought in the [[general store]] in [[Ardougne]] for 24 [[coins]], or from\u00a0[[Ned]]\u00a0in\u00a0[[Draynor Village]]\u00a0for 18.

Chocolate bars can also be bought from Heckel Funch\u00a0on the {{FloorNumber|2}} of the\u00a0Tree Gnome Stronghold, as well as in [[Yanille]] and\u00a0[[Port Sarim]].

His wife, [[Alrena]], is just inside the house (or wandering outside), and she'll tell you she can make a [[gas mask]] if you get her some [[dwellberries]]. Give her the berries, and she'll give you a mask. If you need a spare, there will be one in the cupboard. '''Also, make sure you take the picture of [[Elena]] from inside the house while you're there.'''\n\nTalk to Edmond again, and he'll tell you about his plan to dig under the wall and get into [[West Ardougne]]. First, you'll need to soften the ground. Use your [[Bucket of water|buckets of water]] on the mud patch behind his house (between the cabbages potatoes). You can use one bucket, but you'll have to keep refilling it with the sink inside. Then use the [[spade]] on the softened ground.\n[[File:Plague City grate.png|thumb|220px|Pulling the grate.]]\nYou'll fall under and find Edmond there as well. Walk south, and you'll find a pipe blocked by bars. After pulling it to no avail, just use a [[rope]] on the pipe, and talk to Edmond to pull the grate off. Put on your gas mask and climb inside to go into West Ardougne.\n\n===Finding Elena===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Picture|Elena's picture]].''\n[[File:Plague City map 2.png|thumb|220px|NPC locations.]]\nOnce inside [[West Ardougne]], talk to [[Jethick]]. He's standing a few paces to the east. Show him [[Elena]]'s picture. He'll tell you to go check the Rehnison house and give you a book that he borrowed from them. Head north and a little west (see picture) to find the house sitting right up against the edge of the wall. They'll let you in when you mention you have the book. Once inside, talk to [[Martha Rehnison|Martha]] or [[Ted Rehnison]], and then go upstairs and talk to the daughter of the household, [[Milli Rehnison|Milli]], who'll tell you more about Elena's whereabouts.\n\nHead back out of the house and south of the town square to find the house the girl told you about. You'll recognise it because of a big black \"X\" on the doors. Attempt to open the doors; the [[Mourner]]s won't let you in because it's been hit hard by the plague. Tell them that you're looking for a kidnapped girl, and they'll tell you you need permission from [[Bravek]] to enter the house.\n\n===Getting inside===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[bucket of milk]], [[chocolate dust]] and [[snape grass]].''\n[[File:Plague City Bravek.png|thumb|220px|Talking to Bravek.]]\nGo back to the town square and go into the large building just north of the manhole. Ask the clerk, who is through the door, then tell him you're there for something very important (Say, \"This is urgent though!\"), and he'll let you inside to see [[Bravek]]. He can hardly talk to you, though, as he's badly hung over. He'll give you a tatty piece of paper with a recipe for a [[hangover cure]]. To make it, put the [[chocolate dust]] into the [[bucket of milk]], and add [[snape grass]]. Give the concoction to him (be sure to use the snape grass on the chocolatey milk or else you'll drink it), and tell him that the mourners won't listen to you. After, he'll give you a [[warrant]] that grants the permission you need to go search for [[Elena]] in the plague house.\n[[File:Plague City rescue.png|thumb|220px|Rescuing [[Elena]].]]\nHead back to the house, and try to enter again. The [[Mourner]]s will try to stop you, but when given the warrant from Bravek they'll be rather at a loss, giving you a chance to sneak inside. Once inside, search the barrel to the {{Direction}}west of the staircase to find [[a small key]]. Elena is downstairs. Go downstairs and unlock the door with the key you just found, and release the grateful girl.\n\nHead back to the manhole and talk to [[Edmond]] to finish the quest.

If you can't find ashes already, cut a [[tree]], light the [[logs]], and then wait for it to burn out while banking the axe and tinderbox you no longer need. Alternatively, you can kill an [[Imp]] and take the ashes it drops. Bring your [[shears]] if you already have them to save time. You should also withdraw some cash to pay for the required items and toll gate crossings.\n\nBuy the [[pink skirt]] at the clothes shop, then leave by the south city exit. Buy the 3 (or 4) [[beer]]s at the [[Blue Moon Inn]] on the way out, or take some from the longhall in the [[Barbarian Village]] for free.\n\nAt the [[South-east Varrock mine]], you can mine one [[Tin ore|tin]] and one [[copper ore]] to make a [[bronze bar]], and pick one bunch of [[redberries]] from the nearby bushes, and then go to the sheep pen and shear three sheep. At the [[South-west Varrock mine]], you can mine one [[clay]].\n\nIf you have not already started the quest, then go south into the [[Al Kharid]] desert area, passing the [[Al Kharid mine]], down to the palace and begin the quest; then, talk to [[Hassan]] and then [[Osman]]. Here you can pick up the jug of water that spawns in the east room of the palace. Otherwise, take the road south towards [[Lumbridge]]. Cross the north bridge to the forge, and smith a [[bronze bar]] there, or use the Al Kharid forge if you are there.\n\nGo to [[Lumbridge Castle]] and spin all the wool. Take the jug from the kitchen and fill it with water if you didn't get the jug of water from the palace, then take a pot from the kitchen, and a bucket from the basement if you need them. Fill the bucket with water, wet the clay with it, then fill it again.\n\nFollow the road north out of Lumbridge, then go to the [[Fred the Farmer]]'s house. Behind his house there is a garden with 12 [[onion]]s. Pick two onions, then back to the road for the grain field and mill to make the [[Pot of flour|flour]].\n\nAt this point, you should now be carrying:\n*3 [[Ball of wool|Balls of wool]] (from shearing sheep and then spinning it at a spinning wheel)\n*[[Ashes]] (make or find a fire, once it burns out pick up the ashes, or kill an [[imp]])\n*A [[bucket of water]] or a jug of water ([[bucket]] bought in any [[general store]], filled at any water source)\n*A [[pot of flour]]\n*A [[bronze bar]] (made by smelting [[Tin ore|tin]] and [[copper ore]])\n*[[Soft clay]] (use [[clay]] with a bucket, [[jug]] or [[bowl of water]])\n*2 [[Onion]]s (or [[Yellow dye]]) and 15 [[coins]]\n*3 [[Beer]]s (normal beer, can be bought at the [[Rusty Anchor Inn|Rusty Anchor]] in Port Sarim)\n*A [[pink skirt]]\n*1 [[redberries]]\n*A [[rope]]\n\n===Starting out===\n'''''Items required:''' 3 [[Ball of wool|Balls of wool]], [[rope]] (unless buying from [[Ned]]), 2 [[onion]]s '''or''' [[yellow dye]], 1 [[redberries]], [[Pot of flour|flour]], [[ashes]], a [[bucket of water]], [[soft clay]], a [[bronze bar]], onion and 50 [[coins]] (unless teleporting).''\n\nYou begin your quest in the palace of [[Al Kharid]] by talking to (Chancellor) [[Hassan]]. He will direct you to a shifty looking fellow outside the northern perimeter of the palace, who goes by the name of [[Osman]]. Osman will tell you to find and speak to his daughter [[Leela]], who can be found strolling east of [[Draynor Village]] just south of the wheat field. Talk to Leela and she will tell you what you need.\n\nIf you look west from where you are standing, you should see the door to [[Ned]]'s house. Ask Ned to make you a wig - get the [[rope]] and wig made from the [[Ball of wool|balls of wool]]. Go into the the house just west of Ned's, and ask [[Aggie]] (the witch) to make you a [[yellow dye]] and a [[Paste|skin paste]]. Dye the wig.\n\nGo in to the jail directly east of Draynor as quickly as possible, or attack the guards. This is a [[multicombat area]], however, so unless you're level 26 or higher, you should not attempt to attack them. A good idea would be to bring food, even though they only hit up to a mere 3 damage. If [[Lady Keli]] is not in or around the building, wait a little - she'll respawn. Then, tell her she's famous all over [[RuneScape]], then ask her about her latest plan, and that she must have been very skillful. Ask her then if she's sure his people won't try and rescue him. Ask her if you can see the key and then if you can hold it for a short amount of time. If you've gotten the soft clay with you, you shall make an imprint in the clay.\n\nGo to the bank and get the [[bronze bar]] and 20 [[coins]] and return to Osman so he can make the bronze key. \n\n===Saving the Prince===\n'''''Items required:''' 3 [[Beer]]s, [[rope]], a [[Bronze key (Prince Ali Rescue)|bronze key]], a [[pink skirt]], a [[wig]], and [[Paste|skin paste]].''\n\nTalk to [[Leela]], she will be happy about the plan and recommend that you talk to the witch for the paste, if you have all the ingredients talk to Leela once again and then head for the jail. Talk to Joe and offer him a drink, (be aware that only normal beer will work) and another, and another. Use the rope on [[Lady Keli]], the key on the cell door, then talk to [[Prince Ali]] and he will use the disguise and escape.

Be advised that the guards may stop fighting the higher levels to attack other players. As well, to get them out, have them come outside, and go barely inside so that you are inside and they are outside, and close the door.\n*If you lose any items, you can get them made again, except for the key - [[Leela]] will replace it, at a price.\n*A way out of [[Al Kharid]] to [[Port Sarim]]:\n**Go south to [[Shantay Pass]] and talk to [[Shantay]].\n**Choose \"What is this place?\", and then \"I am an outlaw\".\n**Refuse to pay the 5-coin fine, twice, and you will be transferred to the \"high security\" jail south of Port Sarim, pick the lock to the door, and walk out past the sleeping guard.\n\n==Required for completing==\n*[[Contact!]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*When the player ties up [[Lady Keli]] during the quest, the chatbox states that they put her in a cupboard.

'''If you do not speak to him and go through the entire dialogue, you will be unable to add bones to the pots of vinegar later on unless you talk to him, so doing this will efficiently save you a trip or two.'''\n\n===Seeking the bones===\n''Items required: 38 [[gp]] to travel to [[Karamja]] and to buy [[jug of vinegar|vinegar]], 8 [[Pot|empty pots]] (can be in the bank), a [[rope]], a [[light source]], a tinderbox, a [[spiny helmet]] if you have low combat stats (to defend yourself from [[Wall beast]]s, as they can deal 10-18 damage)''\n\nHere's a list of the creatures you need to kill to obtain bones, and their locations ('''Talk to the odd old man before you begin gathering and go through the entire dialogue'''). The special bone are very high, ''but not 100%'', drops. (''If it doesn't drop within 5-10 kills, attempt in step 6 instead.'') Here is a recommended route for six of the bones starting from the quarry.\n#Run from the quarry to south-east of Varrock and kill a [[Giant rat]] inside the mine, picking up the [[Giant rat bone]] it drops in the process (can be acquired later).\n#Head slightly south of the mine, killing the [[Unicorn]] and the [[Black bear]], picking up the [[Unicorn bone]] (can be acquired later) and the [[Bear ribs]] (ideally, keep killing the bear until you get these to drop).\n#Head into the sheep pen to the south-west of the mine, west of where the [[Black bear]] is usually, and kill [[ram]]s until you get a [[Ram skull]] (can be acquired later).\n#Either teleport or just walk south towards [[Lumbridge]], and kill [[Goblin]]s on the east side of the river until you get a [[Goblin skull]].\n#Head south-east to the graveyard and then south-west to the swamp cave (or the [[Lumbridge Castle]] basement if you have unblocked the route after [[Lost Tribe]]). From there, go down the cave using the [[rope]] (make sure you have a covered [[light source]] - not a candle - and a rope). Go west and then south and you'll see the [[big frog]] (big frogs in the Lumbridge Swamp will not work). Kill it and pick up the [[Big frog leg]].\n#When you exit the cave, go north-west towards Draynor Village. '''If some of the bones did not drop in the earlier steps''', kill giant rats and the unicorn along the way to Draynor, heading north when you find the unicorn to slay goblins behind Lumbridge Castle, or further north-east to kill rams where you did the Sheep Shearer quest.\n\nThis quick circuit is an easy way to get six out of the eight bones right off the bat.\n\nHead to [[Draynor Village]] to purchase 8 (or 35 if intending to do [[Rag and Bone Man II]] as well, to save time) [[jugs of vinegar]] after speaking to [[Fortunato]] at his stall in the town square. '''Do not steal from the market stall or he won't talk to you.''' Withdraw your eight [[pot]]s from the bank, and use the vinegar on the empty pots eight times until you have eight [[pots of vinegar]]. You may use the bones you have gathered so far on the pots of vinegar to save inventory space. This is also a good opportunity to withdraw your [[Digsite pendant]], [[tinderbox]], eight [[logs]] (or [[axe]]) for later on.\n\nThe next two items:\n#If you have a [[Amulet of glory]], use it to teleport to [[Karamja]]. If not, head to [[Port Sarim]], and pay the fare for a ship to [[Karamja]].

It is located close to a [[fairy ring]] (code: {{Fairycode|DKS}}). Simply walk there from [[Rellekka]] if fairy rings are not an option. The trolls are located just south of the entrance.

Go south towards the area full of [[rockslug]]s; then, head east towards the goblins. [[Cave goblin]]s are found at the far east of the [[Lumbridge Swamp Caves]]. You may also take the entrance in the main spot and find them, although you'll need a [[Spiny helmet]].

The guards simply having their backs turned is not enough to keep you from being seen.'''\n\n[[Jimmy Dazzler]] can be found in a house to the west of the [[Flying Horse Inn]] in [[East Ardougne]] on the west side of the river. He needs a house cleared of rats in an unofficial capacity so as not to tarnish his client's reputation; to this end, you will need to sneak around the house unnoticed, avoiding the guards who will think you are an intruder. Jimmy will give you directions to follow to the house. Read them, and you will be prompted to go to the house (it is not located on the [[world map]]\u2014you are teleported there instantly). You will find yourself in front of the house, in the gardens.\n\nTo make your way inside the house, you will need to make sure you don't draw the guard's attention; running permanently is advised and having lots of patience will help greatly. Guards will not notice your cat. There are three \"save points\"; upon reaching these points, any guards who see you will send you back to these points, rather than the beginning.\n[[File:Ratcatchers mansion stealth.png|thumb|220px|Sneaking around the mansion.]]\nKeep your cat in your inventory until you get inside the mansion. If you have a kitten, feed it after each room the kitten catches rats in so you don't forget.\n\nWhen sneaking through the gardens and mansion, unless advised otherwise, wait until the guards stop moving. Try and move when they're as far away from you as they can be.\n\nFrom the start, run west, either staying south of the hedges or going west across the bridge, either works if timed correctly. When you get to the west side of the lawn, go behind the hedge that wraps around the tower-like structure. Wait until the guards are facing away, then run to the north side of the hedge that curves across the north-western corner of the fence. Again, wait until the guards aren't facing the area you're going to head to, then run behind the hedge north of the mansion. If it's clear, climb the trellis at the back of the mansion. This will activate your first checkpoint, located behind the hedge north of the mansion.\n\nFor this next section, it's recommended to go into your advanced game options and turn on \"Always Hide Roofs.\" This will make it a lot easier to see the guards as they move around while you attempt to move inside the mansion.\n\nOn the balcony, move as close as possible to the potted flower on the west side. This square and the corresponding one on the east side are the only two squares on the balcony where the guards cannot spot you. Wait until the guards are well within the area near the stairwell (they may still see you through the doorway even if their back is turned and you are on a diagonal from them), and go inside the bedroom to the west - which is to your right if you are facing south - to find a rat, and use your cat to catch it. '''Note that the doors, once opened, cannot be manually closed!''' It may be safest to go behind the bed and then hop worlds, which should close the door, giving you some privacy and a closer position to make your way to the next area. Pick up your cat until you get to the next room. '''''If your cat gets stuck behind a wall/object while moving around or getting to a room, click on Worn Equipment, and then the \"Call follower\" button at the bottom (looks like a whistle). Your cat will then teleport to be right beside you. You can use this as many times as needed.'''''\n\nFind your way into the opposite bedroom on the east side across the hall and wait. Be patient, and when the '''guard closest to the eastern room''' disappears from sight onto the balcony and the '''guard closest to the western room''' has his back turned walking away to the west, enter the big room to the southeast with two rats, and catch these with your cat. Alternatively, one can enter the bedroom to the east and then wait for the guards to meet on the balcony, then run to the room where the two rats are found (it is directly south of the eastern bedroom\u2014it has no door).\n:'''Note:''' If you're having trouble with this part, try logging on to a different world, as sometimes the guard's patrols become out-of-sync, making this part very difficult to complete.\n\nCatch the two rats in this room; then, proceed down the ladder and catch two rats in that room.\n\nGo through the door to the north and catch one rat in the kitchen.\n\nAll the rats need to be caught in order to proceed. There are a total of six rats to be caught.\n\nOnce you catch all of the rats, teleport out of the mansion and return to Jimmy Dazzler. He will give you access to the Ardougne Rat Pits and tell you about the next person you have to find: [[Hooknosed Jack]].\n\n===Hooknosed Jack===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[cat]] and lots of [[fish]] for it (even if you're using a fully grown cat, both raw or cooked fish works, raw karambwanji works as well, but also stacks), a [[catspeak amulet]], four pieces of [[cheese]], [[rat poison]] or the ingredients for it (a [[vial]], [[red spiders' eggs]], and a [[kwuarm]]), a [[bucket of milk]], a [[marrentill]] and [[unicorn horn dust]].''\n\nYou can find [[Hooknosed Jack|Jack]] in southeastern [[Varrock]] (look for the minigame icon). He will tell you about the rat infestation in a warehouse nearby. You need rat poison, and he will make you some if you give him a vial, red spider eggs, and a kwuarm. Use the poison on four pieces of cheese to create [[poisoned cheese]]; then, go to the warehouse south of the pub. Go in and climb to the top. Use your poisoned cheese on the four rat holes to poison them. Then, go back to Hooknosed Jack.\n\nHe will tell you that his cat, Pox, ate some of the poisoned rats. Go to the [[Apothecary]] (the potion shop in west Varrock). He will ask for a marrentill herb, a crushed unicorn horn, and a bucket of milk to make a special [[cat antipoison]]. Then, give it to Hooknosed Jack to cure Pox.\n[[File:Ratbattle.png|thumb|220px|Fighting the King rat.]]\nHooknosed Jack will then tell you that there is still one rat left - the biggest and most evil. Go back to the warehouse. Climb upstairs and inside a room, you'll see the [[King Rat]], but you won't be able to reach it yourself. Pick up your cat, and use it on the hole in the wall to challenge the King Rat.\n:'''Note:''' Eight or more fish should be enough even for a kitten. A kitten has 4 [[Hitpoints]] while a hellcat has 6 HP (5-6 fish is enough for Hellcat), so bring food accordingly - the king rat has a max hit of 1.\n\nUse fish on the '''hole in the wall (NOT CAT)''' whenever your cat takes too much damage, as it will die if it loses all of its Hitpoints. If you are low on fish, you can go down the ladder and log out then log back in to get your cat back. After you defeat the king rat, go back to Hooknosed Jack. He'll give you access to Varrock's Rat Pits and tell you about [[Smokin' Joe]].\n\n===Smokin' Joe===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[cat]], a [[catspeak amulet]], a [[pot]], some [[weeds]] and a [[tinderbox]].''\n[[File:Ratcatchers Keldagrim smoking.png|thumb|220px|The rats are smoked out of their hole and ambushed by the cat.]]\nGo to [[Keldagrim]] (you can use the entrance northwest of the [[Grand Exchange]], the [[mine carts]], the [[Blast Furnace]] [[minigame teleport]], or the city's entrance east of [[Rellekka]]) and talk to [[Smokin' Joe]] east of the pickaxe shop (far to the east of east Keldagrim). He will tell you about a nearby rat problem. The only way to get the rats out is to smoke them out, but Smokin' Joe can't do it because of the poor condition of his lungs. Offer to help him. Use your weeds on your pot, then light it with your tinderbox and use it on the rat hole to the east of him with your cat out.\u00a0Rats will come out the other side and quickly go back in. Wear your amulet of catspeak, then use your [[smouldering pot]] on the rat hole again, and your cat will offer to help. Accept, and your cat will ambush the rats and kill them. Talk to Smokin' Joe again, and he will give you access to Keldagrim's Rat Pits and tell you about [[The Face]].\n:'''Note:''' If your cat disappears when you use the smouldering pot on the rat hole, simply log out and back in again, or use the call follower button, and it will re-appear next to you.\n\n===The Face and Felkrash===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[cat]], a [[catspeak amulet]], a [[snake charm]], 101 [[coins]] (or 51 with a [[ring of charos]] (a)), a [[ring of dueling]] (for easier access to [[Pollnivneach]]), and a Shantay pass or 5 extra coins.

''\n\n:'''Note:''' If you have extra coins in your inventory, Ali will ask for all of your coins unless you have the ring of charos (a) equipped\n\nYou can find [[The Face]] in [[Port Sarim]] next to the [[Gerrant's Fishy Business|fishing shop]] (look for the mini game icon). She will tell you to talk to [[Felkrash]] in the rat pits. Go down the manhole and find Felkrash. She will tell you to get rid of all of Port Sarim's vermin at once.\n\nTalk to The Face again. She will tell you about a [[snake charmer]] in [[Pollnivneach]]. '''<span style=\"color:red\">Warning:</span>''' '''If you do not speak to The Face before heading to Pollnivneach, the Snake Charmer will not discuss alternate methods of animal charming.'''\n\nGo to Pollnivneach in the desert south of [[Al Kharid]], past the [[Shantay Pass]]. To save time, you can take a [[carpet ride]] directly there for 200 coins (or 100 coins with [[Ring of charos (a)]]), alternatively, you can use a [[Nardah Teleport]] and take a carpet ride there for 200 coins (or 100 coins with [[Ring of charos (a)]]), or with 20 [[Construction]] you can use a [[Scroll of redirection|Scroll of Redirection]] on a [[Teleport to house]] tablet to Pollnivneach. You will find [[Ali the Snake Charmer]] south of the bar. Use one coin on his money pot to get his attention. Ask him about charming other animals, and he will go on to tell you that he and Felkrash had fallen out because of Felkrash's killing of animals. When presented with a multiple-choice dialogue, offer him some coins. Tell him you don't care about his offer and walk away slowly until you get the option to stop. He will reluctantly give you a [[music scroll]] and [[snake charm]] for 100 coins. You can charm him with the ring of charos to lower his price to 50 coins, and also skip the walking-away part.\n:'''Note:''' If you already received a snake charm in [[The Feud]], you will not receive another\n[[File:Ratcatchers Charm Music.png|thumb|220x220px|The music sheet to charm the rats.]]\n[[File:Ratcatchers Port Sarim charming.png|thumb|220px|Charming the rats in Port Sarim.]]\nBack in Port Sarim, stand outside the manhole where The Face is.

He tells you that a hundred years ago, a very important meeting was held in Lumbridge. His ancestor, [[Franizzard Van Lumbcook]], cooked such an amazing banquet for the occasion that he was offered a job as head cook, along with all his descendants, for life. This big, important meeting is held in Lumbridge every ten years and today is the tenth anniversary. As he cannot think of a brilliant dish himself, he intends to use his ancestor's recipe for the feast. However, he needs your help gathering the ingredients, again.\n{{Main|Recipe for Disaster/Another Cook's Quest}}\nAfter completing Another Cook's Quest, you receive an invitation to the feast. Enter the doors to the dining room to observe the feast, and you will see members of the [[Lumbridge Secret Council]] seated at the table.\n\nAs the Duke introduces the rest of the secret council, he is interrupted by the [[Mysterious Old Man]] and is teleported to take care of it. [[Osman]] will then get taken away by [[Evil Bob]]. At this point, you enter the room. A short while later, the [[Culinaromancer]] crashes the party and starts to attack everyone at the dining table with [[magic]] spells.\n\nLuckily, the [[Gypsy]] from [[Varrock]] enters the room and casts \"Tempus Cessit\", which freezes everyone in time, except for you and her. She explains that the [[Culinaromancer]] was a cook in Lumbridge a hundred years ago and had threatened the secret council with death, only to be thwarted by the Duke's assistant, who managed to trap him in another dimension. This assistant was the cook's ancestor, and was made head cook for life.\n\nThe current head cook, whom you helped build the feast, apparently created a powerful food-magic, which released the Culinaromancer from his prison. Seeing him, the Gypsy casts the aforementioned spell, so that you both can protect the council from the Culinaromancer's attacks.

You will see many members of the [[Lumbridge]] council at the table: a [[Mountain Dwarf]] from [[White Wolf Mountain]], [[Osman]] from [[Al Kharid]], the goblin generals from [[Goblin Village]], [[Pirate Pete]] from [[Braindeath Island]], the [[Lumbridge Guide]], [[Evil Dave]] from [[Edgeville]], [[Skrach Uglogwee]] from the [[Feldip Hills]], [[Sir Amik Varze]] from [[Falador]], [[Awowogei]] from [[Ape Atoll]], [[Duke Horacio]] himself and [[Gypsy Aris]] from [[Varrock]], who is arriving late.\n\nRight before you enter, the Duke will get the [[strange box]] event and will leave the room to fiddle with it, and Osman will get taken away by [[Evil Bob]]. At this point, you will enter the room. A short while later, the [[Culinaromancer]] crashes the party and starts to attack everyone at the dining table with [[magic]] spells. Luckily, Gypsy Aris will show up and freeze everyone in time (except you and her).\n\n<gallery>\nThe Culinaromancers return.png|The [[Culinaromancer]] arrives.\nGypsy's Arrival.png|[[Gypsy Aris]] arrives too late.\nTempus Cessit.png|The Gypsy Casts \"Tempus Cessit\" to freeze the room in time.\n</gallery>\n\n<noinclude>===Freeing council members===</noinclude>\nThe [[Gypsy]] explains that the [[Culinaromancer]] was a cook in Lumbridge a hundred years ago and had threatened the secret council with death, only to be thwarted by the Duke's assistant, who managed to trap him in another dimension. This assistant was the cook's ancestor, and was made head cook for life.\n\nThe current head cook, whom you helped build the feast, apparently created a powerful food-magic, which released the Culinaromancer from his prison. Seeing him, the Gypsy casts the aforementioned spell, so that you both can protect the council from the Culinaromancer's attacks. While she can easily seal the Culinaromancer in a heartbeat, due to the fact you caused the Culinaromancer to awaken she holds you responsible and sends you to save them as the magic is causing a temporal paradox that could destroy the known reality with the magic.\n\nAfter the feast, you will be able to enter and exit the dining room at will. However, it will be in a dormant state. To release each member of the council from the Culinaromancer's spell, you must feed each of them their favourite food. The Gypsy and Cook will both be there to help you. You can complete these subquests in any order, and start as many of them at a time as you want. After you give each member their favourite dish, Gypsy teleports them away to safety and tells you how many more council members are left. You will want to inspect all of the guests at once before you do their individual subquests, as they must be inspected or their names in the quest log will remain red. Each subquest gives 1 quest point and some access to the Culinaromancer's Chest, as well as additional rewards such as items or experience.\n\nYou can complete these subquests in any order and start as many of them at a time as you want. Each subquest opens up increased access to the [[Culinaromancer's Chest]], which holds a variety of goods.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that you grow a [[cat|pet kitten]] before you start the subquests if you do not already have a [[cat|fully grown cat]], as it will take two and a half hours for the kitten to grow. If you do this at the start, it should be fully grown and you can save the [[Evil Dave]] subquest for last.\n\n<noinclude>\n{|class=\"wikitable lighttable\" width=\"100%\"\n!Name\n!Requirements\n|-\n|[[File:Mountain Dwarf icon.png]] [[/Freeing the Mountain dwarf|Freeing the Mountain Dwarf]]\n|\n* Able to kill a level 13 [[Icefiend]] (only if you don't have [[ice gloves]])\n* Completion of [[Fishing Contest]]\n|- valign=top\n|[[File:Goblin generals icon.png]] [[/Freeing the Goblin generals|Freeing the Goblin Generals]]\n|\n*Completion of [[Goblin Diplomacy]]\n|-\n|[[File:Pirate Pete icon.png]] [[/Freeing Pirate Pete|Freeing Pirate Pete]]\n|\n* Level 31 {{Skill clickpic|Cooking}}\n* Able to defeat 5 level 35 monsters\n|-\n|[[File:Lumbridge Guide icon (RFD).png]] [[/Freeing the Lumbridge Guide|Freeing the Lumbridge Guide]]\n|\n* Level 40 {{Skill clickpic|Cooking}} Cooking \n* Completion of the following quests:\n** [[Big Chompy Bird Hunting]]\n** [[Biohazard]]\n*** [[Plague City]]\n** [[Demon Slayer]]\n** [[Murder Mystery]]\n** [[Nature Spirit]]\n*** [[Priest in Peril]]\n*** [[The Restless Ghost]]\n** [[Witch's House]]\n|- valign=top\n|[[File:Evil Dave icon.png]] [[/Freeing Evil Dave|Freeing Evil Dave]]\n|\n* Level 25 {{Skill clickpic|Cooking}}\n* Completion of the following quests:\n** [[Gertrude's Cat]]\n** [[Shadow of the Storm]]\n*** [[Demon Slayer]]\n*** [[The Golem]]\n|-\n|[[File:Monkey Ambassador icon.png]] [[/Freeing King Awowogei|Freeing King Awowogei]]\n|\n* Level 70 {{Skill clickpic|Cooking}} (boostable)\n* Level 48 {{Skill clickpic|Agility}}\n* Able to defeat a level 84 [[Big Snake]]\n* Completion of the following quests:\n** [[Monkey Madness I]]\n*** [[The Grand Tree]]\n*** [[Tree Gnome Village]]\n|-\n|[[File:Sir Amik Varze icon.png]] [[/Freeing Sir Amik Varze|Freeing Sir Amik Varze]]\n|\n* 107 {{Skill clickpic|Quest}} Quest points\n* Access to the [[Kharazi Jungle]] (started [[Legends' Quest]])\n* Completion of the following quests:\n** [[Family Crest]]\n** [[Heroes' Quest]]\n*** [[Shield of Arrav]]\n*** [[Lost City]]\n*** [[Merlin's Crystal]]\n*** [[Dragon Slayer]]\n** [[Shilo Village]]\n*** [[Jungle Potion]]\n**** [[Druidic Ritual]]\n** [[Underground Pass]]\n*** [[Biohazard]]\n**** [[Plague City]]\n** [[Waterfall Quest]]\n* The ability to defeat a level 227 [[Black dragon]]\n|- valign=top\n|[[File:Skrach Uglogwee icon.png]] [[/Freeing Skrach Uglogwee|Freeing Skrach Uglogwee]]\n|\n* Level 41 {{Skill clickpic|Cooking}} (cannot boost)\n* Level 20 {{Skill clickpic|Firemaking}}\n* Completion of [[Big Chompy Bird Hunting]]\n|}\n</noinclude>\n<!--Transclusion section for Full Guide -->\n<includeonly>\n===Freeing the Goblin generals===\n{{:Recipe for Disaster/Freeing the Goblin generals}}\n\n===Freeing the Mountain dwarf===\n{{:Recipe for Disaster/Freeing the Mountain dwarf}}\n\n===Freeing Evil Dave===\n{{:Recipe for Disaster/Freeing Evil Dave}}\n\n===Freeing the Lumbridge Guide===\n{{:Recipe for Disaster/Freeing the Lumbridge Guide}}\n\n===Freeing Pirate Pete===\n{{:Recipe for Disaster/Freeing Pirate Pete}}\n\n===Freeing Skrach Uglogwee===\n{{:Recipe for Disaster/Freeing Skrach Uglogwee}}\n\n===Freeing Sir Amik Varze===\n{{:Recipe for Disaster/Freeing Sir Amik Varze}}\n\n===Freeing King Awowogei===\n{{:Recipe for Disaster/Freeing King Awowogei}}\n\n===Defeating the Culinaromancer===\n{{:Recipe for Disaster/Defeating the Culinaromancer}}\n\n</includeonly>\n\n<noinclude>===Defeating the Culinaromancer===</noinclude>\n\nAfter saving the final member of the Secret Council, the Culinaromancer will retreat through a portal back into his own dimension.

He will tell you to talk to [[Sir Tiffy Cashien]] in [[Falador Park]] to be tested. In order to be able to be tested, you need to have an empty inventory and no items equipped. At this point, it is safe to change your gender to female but you will not be refunded unless you speak to Sir Amik first.\n\nNow, head to Falador Park, and talk to Sir Tiffy Cashien. He will tell you that you must go through a mental test. You need to be female for one of the tests so visit the [[Make-over Mage]] before starting if you aren't already. You must start the quest as male to receive the make-over voucher. If you switch to female before you talk to Sir Amik Varze, you will not receive a voucher or a refund.\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:Recruitment Drive - Talking to Sir Tiffy.png|thumb|left|200px|Talking to [[Sir Tiffy Cashien]].]]\n[[Sir Tiffy Cashien]] will take you to the testing grounds. There are seven different testing rooms. In each room, there is a yellow portal at the beginning of the room (takes you back to [[Falador]]) and a yellow portal at the end of the room, which you may use to travel to the next room after you pass the test. You need to complete five in a row. Which five you'll get, as well as the order that they are in, is completely random. However, you will '''always''' be required to defeat [[Sir Leye]] in one of the five tests. If you fail a test, you have no choice but to return to Falador and start over.\n\n===Sir Kuam Ferentse===\n[[File:Recruitment Drive - Talking to Sir Kuam Ferentse.png|thumb|200px|Talking to [[Sir Kuam Ferentse]].]]\n[[Sir Kuam Ferentse|He]] tells you that you must defeat [[Sir Leye]], who is level 20. Sir Leye has been blessed by [[Saradomin]] so that no man may defeat him. So, unless you have a '''female [[character]]''', you will not be able to hit the final blow on him. Defeat him to pass the test. If you die, you may return and finish the quest after one final trial. <span style=\"color:red\">'''WARNING:'''</span> You '''WILL''' lose your [[Hardcore Ironman]] Status should you fall to Sir Leye. '''NOTE:''' [[Skiller]]s can trap Leye in the corners of the room and [[flinch]] him by waiting for his HP bar to go away and then hitting and running. Skillers may find this part impracticable because Sir Leye is very difficult to get into the corner positions ''and'' he will take damage very slowly, to the point where he may heal faster than the damage being done.\n\n===Sir Spishyus===\n[[File:Recruitment Drive - Talking to Sir Spishyus.png|thumb|left|200px|Talking to [[Sir Spishyus]].]]\nRight next to [[Sir Spishyus|him]], you'll see a 5&nbsp;kg chicken, a 5&nbsp;kg bag of grain, and a 5&nbsp;kg fox. You must get all three of them across a bridge that only supports five kilograms at a time. The tricky part is that if you leave the fox and chicken alone, the fox will eat the chicken. The chicken will also eat the bag of grain if the two of them are left alone.\n[[File:Recruitment Drive - Walking across the bridge.png|thumb|200px|Crossing the bridge.]]\n# Take the chicken to the other side, since the fox and grain are the only pair that actually get along.\n# Drop the chicken, then come back and grab the fox.\n# Take it to the other side then grab the chicken and drop the fox. Then take the chicken back to the start.\n# Grab the grain, drop the chicken, and take the grain across the bridge.\n# Drop the grain, then go back to the beginning for the chicken and take it across.\n\nOnce you complete the puzzle, the door now unlocks and you can proceed to the next puzzle via the portal.\n\n===Lady Table===\n[[File:Recruitment Drive - Statue Room.png|thumb|200px|The bronze, silver, and gold statues used in the memory test.]]\n<span style=\"color:red\">'''Important:'''</span> Make a screenshot of the statues as you enter the room (or remember the statues if you have a good memory). You only have a few seconds after you enter the room!\n\n[[Lady Table]] will test your memory. She will have 11 statues of a knight in front of her. There are supposed to be 12, but one has been taken away. You will have a few seconds to look at the statues, then the missing one will be returned. You must then touch the one that was missing.\n\nThe trick to passing this one is to analyse the types of statues. There should be four statues of each colour: bronze, silver, and gold. First, see which colour only has '''three statues'''. After you figure out the colour, figure out the weapon. There are four weapons: [[sword]], [[halberd]], greataxe, and [[mace]]. Figure out which weapon is missing. After you have figured it out, touch the statue.\n\n===Miss Cheevers===\n[[File:Recruitment Drive - Talking to Miss Cheevers.png|thumb|200px|Talking to [[Miss Cheevers]].]]\nThere are many bookcases and crates with items.

Use the answer to unlock the combination lock on the next door. The possible solutions are:\u00a0'''FISH''',\u00a0'''BITE''',\u00a0'''RAIN''',\u00a0'''LAST''',\u00a0'''PASS''',\u00a0'''TIME''',\u00a0'''CLUE''', or\u00a0'''MEAT'''.\n\n===Miss Hynn Terprett===\n[[File:Recruitment Drive - Talking to Ms Hynn Terprett.png|thumb|200px|Talking to [[Miss Hynn Terprett]].]]\n[[Miss Hynn Terprett|She]] will give you a multiple choice riddle. There are many to choose from - they are as follows:\n\n'''Riddle:''' ''If you were sentenced to death, what would you rather choose - being drowned in a lake of acid, burned on a fire, thrown to a pack of wolves that have not been fed in over a month or thrown from the walls of a castle, many hundreds of feet high.''\n:'''Answer:''' Being fed to the wolves - wolves cannot survive for 30 days without food, thus they would all be dead.\n\n'''Riddle:''' ''I have both a husband and daughter. My husband is four times older than my daughter. In twenty years time, he will be twice as old as my daughter. How old is my daughter now?''\n:'''Answer:''' Her daughter is 10 years old because <math>10*4=40</math> and <math>\\frac{(40+20)}{2}=10+20</math> .\n\n'''Riddle:''' ''I dropped four identical stones, into four identical buckets, each containing an identical amount of water. The first bucket was at 32 degrees Fahrenheit, the second was at 33 degrees, the third was at 34 and the fourth was at 35 degrees. Which bucket's stone dropped to the bottom of the bucket last?''\n:'''Answer:''' The first bucket (Bucket A). Water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius).\n\n'''Riddle:''' ''Counting the creatures and humans in RuneScape, you get about a million inhabitants. If you multiply the fingers on everything's left hand by zero, how many would you get?''\n:'''Answer:''' Zero. If even one creature has no fingers on their left hand, you are multiplying by zero, which yields zero.\n\n'''Riddle:''' ''Which of the following is true? The number of false statements here is one. The number of false statements here is two. The number of false statements here is three. The number of false statements here is four. How many false statements are there?''\n:'''Answer:''' Logic dictates that the number of false statements must be three. There are four possible answers, so for one of them to be true, all others must be false.\n'''Riddle:''' ''What would be the number you would get if you multiply the number of fingers on everythings left hand to the nearest million''\n:'''Answer:''' 0 \n\n===Sir Tinley===\nTalk to [[Sir Tinley]], and wait for a few moments after you click on \"continue\" for the first time. Do not click on '''anything''' while you wait, or you will fail this task.\n\n====Finishing up====\nAfter completing all five tests subsequently, you will automatically be teleported back into [[Falador Park]] where [[Sir Tiffy Cashien]] will congratulate you on a job well done.\n\n'''Congratulations!

Once there, you will meet some scouts of his.\n\nSee the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|separate guide]] for instructions about how to get through the pass. If you have just enough [[agility potion]]s to complete the required elf traps, do not waste them here as it takes another voyage through the pass to get back to the elf lands.\n\nOnce you are at [[Lord Iban|Iban]]'s temple, go in and talk to [[Koftik]] if you require food. Iban will no longer be there, so you can simply climb down the Well of Voyage. Go out the cave.\n\n===Isafdar===\nWelcome to [[Tirannwn]]! Go into the forest just a little bit and wait for an elf named [[Idris]] to spawn and start a dialogue with you. This may take a little while. He will question why you are here, but he is slain by [[Essyllt]] and [[Morvran]] before he has the chance to finish. They will tell you to talk to [[Lord Iorwerth]], who can be found at the camp in the north-west corner of the forest.\n\nBefore proceding with the quest, here is a detailed map of [[Tirannwn]]:[[File:Isafdar map.png|thumb|600px|centre]]\n\nAs you navigate the forest, you will encounter four different obstacles:\n* <u>Dense forest</u>: You will learn how to navigate this obstacle after speaking to an [[Elf Tracker]] later in the quest. 56 [[Agility]]\u00a0is required to push through the dense forest, though this is not required to return back to the starting point of this obstacle (e.g., returning from [[Tyras Camp]] to the forest). This obstacle cannot be failed.\n\n*<u>Leaf trap</u>: This obstacle is a pitfall that appears\u00a0as a circle of leaves on the ground. '''Click \"Jump Over\" on the side of the trap that is closest to where you are standing.''' If you ignore or\u00a0fail the trap, you will fall through the leaves and lose 15 [[HP]].\n\n*<u>Tripwire</u>: You will see two rocks connected by a thin wire with four small crossbows pointing at them. Right click between the rocks to step over the tripwire. If you ignore or fail the trap, you will lose 10 [[HP]] and be poisoned.\n\n*<u>Stick trap</u>: This obstacle appears as some sticks on the ground. Click \"Pass\" on the obstacle. If you ignore or fail the trap, you will lose 8 [[HP]].\n\n===Getting through the forest===\nMake your way to the [[Elf Camp]] in the north-west corner. See the map above for reference.\n*From the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] exit, head west and take the south split in the path to avoid the stick trap.\n*Keep going west until you see a leaf trap (pitfall) to the south. Jump over it.\n*Keep going south until you reach two small pools of water. Go west and cross the stick trap.\n*Head up the north-west path and jump over the leaf trap. Keep heading north and cross the log balance to reach the camp.\nAt the camp, speak with [[Lord Iorwerth]]. He will tell you to talk to his tracker after you tell him that [[King Lathas]] sent you.\n*Head back down the path you took to reach the camp, but head south when you reach the stick trap.\nThe [[Elf Tracker]] is near the [[Poison Waste]]. He will not believe what you say since you are a human, so return to [[Lord Iorwerth]] to get a [[crystal pendant]]. Put it on and talk to the tracker again. He will tell you to find the [[Tyras Camp]].\n[[File:Tyras guard safe spot.png|thumb|220px|A safespot is available to fight the Tyras guard.]]\nClick \"Follow\" on the footprints near the dense forest to the west before returning to the tracker.\u00a0You will now be able to climb through dense forest if you have 56 [[Agility]]. '''You will have to pass through dense forest six times during the quest, bring at least 6 of the appropriate Agility boost.'''\n\nClimb through the nearest dense forest and a level-110 [[Tyras guard]] will attack you, equipped with a [[steel halberd]].\u00a0Despite having a halberd, he does not have a 2-square attack range. You can use a safespot or [[Protect from Melee]] to make the fight easier. If you take too long in killing him, he will despawn, and you will have to try to summon him again or kill the guard by the entrance to the Tyras camp. This guard does not despawn, but he does in fact have a 2-square attack range, and there is a lack of suitable safespots nearby. After you have killed him, proceed to the Tyras Camp, stepping over the tripwire to the north-west if you killed the first guard. Climb through the dense forest to the north and then head west. You will find [[Tyras Camp]] past the dense forest that is south of the catapult.\n\nTalk to [[General Hining]], and pick up a [[barrel]] before leaving the camp. '''Note:''\u00a0''it is recommended that you\u00a0pick up\u00a0several barrels (at least three)\u00a0since failing the distillation puzzle found later in the quest will require you to travel through the underground pass to collect another'''. Another [[barrel of naphtha]] will be required for the [[Mourning's End Part I]] quest.\u00a0Additionally, you can buy bread from the general store if you are low on food.\u00a0Go back to the Elf Tracker; then, talk to Lord Iorwerth.\n\n===Getting the materials===\n[[Lord Iorwerth]] will give you the [[Big book of bangs|Big Book O' Bangs]]. '''Don't drop this book''' - you need it when in [[Rimmington]] later.\u00a0In order to build the explosive, you will need a [[barrel of coal-tar]], [[sulphur]], and [[limestone]]. Here is how to gather the materials:\n[[File:Coal tar spot.png|thumb|217x217px|The location to obtain the coal-tar.]]\n#Head back to the [[Elf Tracker]]. Go to the poison waste swamp south of the tracker and fill your barrels with coal-tar.\n#Gather some of the [[sulphur]] from beside the poison waste swamp.\n#If you don't have [[limestone]] yet, you can mine it in the forest. Cross the log balance and head east of the elf camp, through the dense forest, and north-east past the gates of the elven city. Find some [[limestone rock]]s and mine one piece of limestone. There is a limestone mine north-east of [[Varrock]] as well.\n\n===Making the barrel of naphtha===\n:'''Note:''' If you are planning to do [[Mourning's Ends Part I]], make sure you make another [[barrel of naphtha]] ('''''NOT''''' a completed [[Barrel Bomb]]) and keep it in the bank. (Don't forget to collect twice the materials.)\n\nMake sure you have at least one [[barrel of coal-tar]], the [[big book of bangs]], and some [[sulphur]].\u00a0'''After this, it is safe to teleport out of Isafdar.''' If you did not get the [[limestone]], it can be mined on the path to [[Canifis]], north-east of [[Varrock]]. Additionally, make a [[strip of cloth]] on the loom in the farm south of [[Falador]] if you haven't already.\n\n====Heading to Rimmington====\nBefore heading to Rimmington, grind the sulphur''' '''with a pestle and mortar '''with gloves equipped'''. Use the limestone on a furnace, which produces [[quicklime]]. '''With gloves equipped and a pot in the inventory, grind the quicklime into dust using the pestle and mortar'''. The pestle and mortar and gloves are no longer needed. Grab at least 15 pieces of [[coal]] (taking extra coal noted is helpful in case you mess up, you can exchange for unnoted coal and 5 coins per banknote in the house near the [[POH]] portal). Finally, to distill the barrel of coal tar into naphtha, bring the [[barrel of coal tar]] (two if doing Mourning's End Part I, the second only needs to be distilled), the pot of [[quicklime]], [[ground sulphur]], [[strip of cloth]], coal (suggested 9 per barrel, but will likely only need 10 total) and the [[Big book of bangs|book]] regarding the bomb creation. Teleport to [[Falador]], or your house if it is in [[Rimmington]], or teleport to [[Pest Control]]/Port Sarim Rat Pits using the [[Minigame Group Finder|quick teleport]]. Now, find the [[Chemist]] that resides there (he is in a building south-west of the house portal). Talk about the quest, and he will give you permission to use the distiller. Now, use the barrel of coal tar on the large distiller outside.\n\n'''Read this whole section first before you distill! You will lose the barrel of coal tar if the pressure or heat rises in excess of the red zone.'''\n[[File:Making naphtha.png|thumb|220px|The interface when making a barrel of naphtha.]]\nThe idea of using this distiller is to keep pressure and heat at an even ratio. Add coal to start raising heat levels, turn the valve for heat to the middle notch and keep it there. You may notice the pressure valve go up as well because the valve is closed. Let the pressure go up to the green area, but pay attention to the heat level.\u00a0''Add coal as needed, optimally to maintain the heat gauge in the green zone, but it could be played more safely by keeping it well below overheating.''\n\n'''A very easy way to do this is:'''\n# Turn the valve on the right all the way to the third tick (all the way to the right).\n# Wait for the pressure gauge to land in the green zone.\n# Turn the valve on the left to the second tick (in the middle) to halt the pressure in the green zone. If it landed in the red zone, you could turn the valve right to relieve some pressure, then back to the middle.\n# '''The valves never need to be touched again, and the pressure gauge can be ignored.'''\n# Add 2 coal, and then 1 additional coal whenever the heat gauge falls too low (below, or counterclockwise from, the green zone). '''Don't spam click the \"add coal\" button. If you add 4 at once, it is likely to overheat''' and you will lose your barrel of coal-tar. The process is fast and may use only 4-5 coal.\nThe bar on the bottom should start turning green. When it is full, stop adding coal and close the window to replace your empty barrel with a [[barrel of naphtha]].\n\n===Making the bomb (skip to step 4 if you have all the items already)===\n*If you did not already make the quicklime, equip your [[gloves]]. If you do not, you will take damage when making [[quicklime]]. Then, use your [[limestone]] on a [[furnace]], with a [[pot]] in your inventory, and grind your quicklime with a [[pestle and mortar]] to get a [[pot of quicklime]].\n*If you did not already do so, grind your [[sulphur]] with your pestle and mortar to create [[ground sulphur]].\n*If you have not yet made a [[strip of cloth]], use four [[balls of wool]] on a loom. There is one in the [[Elf Camp]], and another in the farm near [[Falador]].\n*Add the ground sulphur and pot of quicklime to your [[barrel of naphtha]] to seal the bomb, then use the strip of cloth on it to complete the [[barrel bomb]].\n\n===Regicide===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Spade]], [[bow]], [[arrows]], [[rope]], [[plank]], [[tinderbox]], (to get through the [[Underground Pass]] again) a [[cooked rabbit]], and of course, your completed [[barrel bomb]]. [[Agility potion]]s '''and''' [[anti-poison]]s if you need any.''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' [[axe]] (if you need to get a cooked rabbit), runes for [[Ardougne teleport]].''\n[[File:Barrel bomb explodes.png|thumb|220px|The barrel bomb destroys King Tyras' tent.]]\n'''Note: '''The [[barrel bomb]] weighs a lot, and will make it more difficult to succeed during agility obstacles such as traps and gap-jumping.\n\nNow that you have the [[barrel bomb]], go all the way through the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] '''one last time.''' Kill a [[rabbit]] and cook it on any fire. If you did not bring an [[axe]], there are lit fires in the [[Elf Camp|Elven Camp]]. Then, go to the catapult outside the [[Tyras Camp]]. Talk to the guard, and give him some rabbit meat to distract him. Then, use the bomb on the catapult ([[tinderbox]] required, you may also buy one from the store at the camp), and it will explode on [[King Tyras]]. Using it on the catapult winch will result in a \"Nothing interesting happens\".\n\nGo back to [[Lord Iorwerth]]. He will give you [[Iorwerths message|a letter]] to take to [[King Lathas]] and then give you access to the overground pass of [[Arandar]]. Take the Underground Pass or teleport away; then, go to [[Ardougne Castle]]. On the way, an elf named [[Arianwyn]] will break the magic seal on the letter and tell you to read it. You will learn that King Tyras wasn't the main antagonist in the quest, and that his brother, King Lathas, is the main antagonist and is serving the Dark Lord in hopes of reclaiming [[Camelot]]. Return the letter to King Lathas to complete the quest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Regicide\n|image = [[File:Regicide reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 3\n|rewards = *13,750 [[Agility]] [[experience]]\n*15,000 [[Coins]]\n*Access to the elven kingdom of [[Tirannwn]] and the overpass of [[Arandar]]\n*Access to the [[dragon halberd]] (325,000 coins at the [[Tyras Camp]])\n*The ability to charter a [[Charter ship|ship]] to [[Port Tyras]]\n*The ability to use [[Elf camp teleport|Elf Camp teleport scrolls]]\n*The ability to use [[Zul-andra teleport|Zul-andra teleport scrolls]] and kill [[Zulrah]]\n}}\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Regicide is required for the following:\n*[[Roving Elves]]\n\n{{Regicide}}"], "Romeo & Juliet": ["{{External|rs|rsc}}\n{{Has quick guide}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Romeo & Juliet\n|number = 4\n|image = [[File:Romeo & Juliet.png|300px]]\n|members = No\n|release = 4 January [[2001]]\n|update = Runescape beta is now online!\n|series = None\n|difficulty = Novice\n|developer = Rob L, Paul Gower\n}}\n'''Romeo & Juliet''' is one of the first [[quests]] released in ''[[RuneScape]]'', and is one of the most commonly recognised.\n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Speak to Romeo in [[Varrock Square]].\n|difficulty = 1\n|description = [[Romeo]] and [[Juliet]] are desperately in love, but Juliet's father doesn't approve.

He suggests going to [[Father Lawrence]], who is located in the church north-east of Varrock Square. Speak to Father Lawrence.

Speak to the Apothecary, and he will tell you he needs [[cadava berries]], you may need to ask him to talk about something else. The berries can be found on a bush located west of the mine south-east of Varrock. When you have them, return to the Apothecary, and he will give you the potion.\n\n'''Be careful''' as drinking the potion yourself would result in temporarily knocking yourself out.[[File:Romeo & Juliet - Crypt.png|thumb|Romeo and Juliet in the crypt]]\nNow, head back to Juliet, and give her the potion.

The elves teleport back and forth between the two spots every few minutes, so be patient or switch worlds if they're not there. If you don't find him after a couple minutes, it is much quicker to check the other possible locations.\n[[File:Isafdar map.png|thumb|centre|500px]]\n\n===Getting there===\nThere are several options to reach [[Islwyn]] and [[Eluned]] to start the quest (listed below). Islwyn and Eluned move every few minutes to one of the orange circles marked on the map above. '''They are not in the spot near the bridge''', so they can only be found south-west of [[Lletya]] near a [[magic tree]] or north-east of [[Tyras Camp]] at a glade. You will need to pass through dense forest, which requires 56 [[Agility]], but it can be boosted with Agility potions from 53 Agility or [[Summer pie]]s from 51 Agility (bring more than one). It is also recommended you bring plenty of [[food]] and some [[Antipoison potion]]s for the tripwire traps. If you arrive at one of the locations and the elves are not there, simply wait until they arrive or [[switch worlds]]. \n:'''Note:''' If you need to navigate the entire Underground Pass, please see [[Underground Pass (dungeon)]].\n\n==== Option 1: Charter ship ====\nThe easiest way to reach the start point of this quest is to use a [[Charter Ship]] to [[Port Tyras]]. This has several major advantages over other methods of transportation, with the only downside being the cost of 3.2k (or 1.6k with the [[Ring of charos(a)]]). This route avoids all trip wire traps, and is the shortest route to either of the start points of the quest. Furthermore, the [[dense forest]] you have to pass through does not require 56 [[Agility]] in this direction. Note that this does mean you are unable to go back to Port Tyras if you do not have level 56 agility and nothing to boost. Bring teleports if this is the case.\n\n==== Option 2: Underground pass ====\n#From the exit of the Underground Pass, follow the path westward, and jump over the leaf trap to the south.\n#Enter the dense forest to the east after jumping the leaves.\n#Go east over the tripwire, and head south past the level 88 [[dire wolves]].\n\n==== Option 3: Elf camp teleport ====\n#Use an [[Elf camp teleport]], which can be bought on the [[Grand Exchange]] or from players.\n#Head south and cross the log balance.\n#Continue heading south and cross the leaf trap, then continue heading south until you reach the [[Elf Tracker]] (silver diamond on the map above).\n#Head west through the dense forest, head north through the trip wires, then head north through the dense forest.\n#Head a bit north-west, then head south to the stick trap to reach a clearing with a small pond.\n\n===Starting out===\n#Talk to [[Islwyn]], and tell him the truth.\n#Offer to help, and you'll be directed to [[Eluned]].\n#[[Eluned]] asks you to retrieve the [[consecration seed]] from [[Glarial's Tomb]] by defeating \"the guardian spirit\" (a level 84 [[Moss giant (Roving Elves)|moss giant]]) unarmed, so [[bank]] all [[armour]] and [[Weapons|weaponry]], grab [[Glarial's pebble]], plenty of [[food]], and head over to the tomb.\n\n===The pebble===\nIf you have [[Glarial's pebble]], you can skip this section. Otherwise:\n*Go to the [[Tree Gnome Village (location)|Tree Gnome Village]]. Just outside the loose rail, head down the ladder to the east.\n*Once down the ladder, head west.\n*Talk to [[Golrie]] until you get [[Glarial's pebble]].\n\n===The tomb===\n[[File:Glarials Tombstone.png|thumb|220px|Glarial's Tombstone.]]\n''Do '''not''' take any [[armour]], [[weapons]], [[runes]] (for teleportation) with you, also don't bring a clue scroll along in your inventory.'' \n'''All [[capes]], and [[gloves]] that gives bonuses are not allowed, including [[Ardougne cloak]]s and the Graceful Outfit!!''' However, [[jewellery]], including jewellery that gives stat bonuses (such as an [[amulet of fury]] or [[combat bracelet]]) ''are'' allowed, as well as Fremmenik rings, such as the [[Berserker ring]]. You can bring teleport tablets. Also, the [[Event rpg]], a weapon that lets you [[melee]] at rapid speed, can be taken in. The [[monk's robe top]] and [[Monk's robe|bottom]] ''are'' allowed. [[God blessing]]s are also permitted. Bringing a [[dramen branch]] and a [[knife]] to make a [[dramen staff]] will ''not'' work here.\n\nYou will have to kill one [[Moss giant (Roving Elves)|moss giant]] unarmed; however, you can take [[food]] and [[Herblore#Potions|potions]] with you. It is suggested to use a [[super potion set]] if you have them. Lots of food is suggested, as the giant could do a frequent max hit of 14. [[Prayer]] can be used here, and a [[ring of recoil]] works.\n*Use the games necklace to teleport to Barbarian Outpost, or skills necklace to [[Fishing Guild]]. Look for a greyed out area on minimap, directly left of <nowiki>''Kingdom of Kandarin''</nowiki>. Use your pebble with the tombstone to get down. You will be down a ladder.\n*If it says that nothing happens, you are carrying an item that is not allowed down there. Remove those items and get back.\n\n===The consecration seed===\n[[File:Roving Elves moss giant.png|thumb|220px|[[Glarial's Tomb]]. Strangely, there is a symbol of [[Zaros]] instead of [[Seren]].]]In the tomb, you will find two aggressive level 84 [[Moss giant (Roving Elves)|moss giants]], one just west of where you climb down the ladder, and one in a small room with a chest west of that. They use a slow, but accurate combined [[magical melee]] attack, so they hit with both in 1 hit and can hit up to 14. You must kill one of them to get the [[consecration seed]].\n*Should you not be able to finish the first time, you can return to the bank and retrieve some more food. Upon returning, the moss giant you were attacking will have the same amount of life it did when you left.\n*Another strategy is getting the moss giant stuck behind a pillar, hitting it, then running behind the pillar. It takes a little bit longer, and you occasionally take some damage but you should be able to do it, with a little bit of food in your inventory.\n*A third tactic is to bring a [[games necklace]]. When you die, teleport to the [[Barbarian Outpost]], go down the falls, and attack the moss giant again. Repeat this process until it dies.\n\n*('''Optional''') - Use an [[elf camp teleport]] to go back and see [[Eluned]].\n\n=== Enchanting the consecration seed ===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Consecration seed]], [[Agility]] boost if not level 56. '''Recommended:''' [[Food]], [[antipoison]], [[coins]] or an [[Elf camp teleport]], and an [[Ardougne teleport|Ardougne]] or [[Camelot teleport]] for the next section.''\n\nTake the seed back to [[Eluned]]. [[Chartering]] a ship to [[Port Tyras]] is the fastest way to get to her. Since you will need to pass dense forest, do not forget agility boosts if you are not level 56. You do not need 56 Agility to leave Port Tyras through the dense forest. 56 Agility is only required when entering the port through the dense forest. Eluned will enchant your [[consecration seed]].\n\n===Through the waterfall===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Rope]], a [[spade]], and the '''enchanted''' [[consecration seed]]. '''Recommended:''' [[Food]], [[armour]], Barbarian Outpost tele (Games Necklace) .''\n\nTake all the items for this part, and go to the [[Waterfall Dungeon]]. If you don't know how, follow the steps below:\n*Go to the starting location of the [[Waterfall Quest]] (the house north-west of the [[Glarial's Tomb|tomb]] where you got the seed). Enter the house; then, head west outside to find a raft.\n**If using games necklace, head south once you teleport.\n*Take the raft to get down the river. You will crash halfway.\n*Use your rope on the rock to get to the next island (this may require moving your camera around to find it). Do not use the \"swim\" option.\n*Use your rope on the dead tree next to you to get down to the entrance. Enter the dungeon.\n\n===Planting the seed===\n[[File:Planting consecration seed.gif|thumb|220px|The player plants the [[consecration seed]], and a crystal tree grows.]]\n*From here, first take the path to the eastern room. Go to the crates located the furthest to the north. Search them to find a [[A key (Waterfall Dungeon)|key]].\n*Now, go back to the main room and then west. Go past the [[fire giant]]s to a locked door. Use your key on it to get through (the same key spawns on the floor inside).\n*Use the key on the next door to the north. You will be inside the room where you finished the [[Waterfall Quest]].\n*Go to the chalice and left-click the seed while standing next to it. You will dig a hole, bury the seed and see a small crystal tree growing. You must have a spade in your inventory for it to work. It will disappear right away.\n*Either teleport out or walk outside the waterfall and get inside the barrel there.\n\n===Ending===\nGo back to [[Islwyn]] to claim your reward. Pick either a [[crystal bow]] or a [[crystal shield]]. Both can be bought later; the bow is 900,000 [[coins]] and the shield is 750,000 coins. (They are both 2/10 charged and thus untradeable.)\n\n''Tip:'' If you plan on completing the [[Western Provinces Diary]], choose the crystal bow as it's needed for a hard diary task.

Prince Brand and Princess Astrid suggest that you have to marry the [[King Vargas|King]] to [[Queen Sigrid]].\n*King Vargas says that items have been going missing - you need to talk to various island workers.\n*Speak to either [[Gunnhild]] by the herbs, [[Leif]] by the trees, [[Fisherman Frodi|Frodi]] on the dock, or [[Miner Magnus|Magnus]] by the mines (they will all say the same thing, you only need to talk to one of them). Apparently, [[Etceteria]] came to ask for tithes, the workers refused, and the next day items were stolen.\n\n===More stolen goods===\n*Talk to the [[King Vargas|King]] again, he tells you to talk to [[Queen Sigrid]].\n*Speak to Queen Sigrid in [[Etceteria]]. She tells you to talk to her citizens about things gone missing and other stuff, once again criticising the king whenever she gets the chance.\n*Speak to [[Matilda]] in the marketplace inside the castle walls, and she will tell you the same story as the workers in [[Miscellania]].\n*Speak to Queen Sigrid, and update her on the known information. Soldiers have been mentioned in both stories, and she has no army.\n*Be sure to have the things you will need for the fight at this point. Remember to take [[antipoison potion]]s and [[prayer potion]]s as needed. It is recommended to leave about 10 inventory spaces open for items you're going to use later on during the quest.\n\n===To the dungeon with you!===\n*Speak to [[King Vargas]] about finding out that the Miscellanians don't have an army either, and he says he could make one, and this is arousing suspicion, so you ask what else you can do to further the investigation.\n*Speak to [[Advisor Ghrim]], and he will tell you to talk to people to find out if they had seen any suspicious characters.\n*Speak to the [[Sailor]] at the docks of [[Miscellania]], and he will mention a group of children who said they had gone to go visit their family in the dungeon.\n*Speak to King Vargas to get access to the dungeon. He gives you a [[Scroll (Royal Trouble)|scroll]] with his signature.\n*Take the scroll with you and enter the dungeon (in [[Miscellania Castle]], {{FloorNumber|1}}, look for the dungeon mark on the [[minimap]]), and you will arrive in a small underground town. Find and\u00a0speak to a dwarf called [[Donal]], who is at the pub.\n\n===Repairing the lift===\n[[File:Royal Trouble lift fixed.png|right|thumb|250px|The lift is operational again.]]\n*Speak with [[Donal]], who is located in the [[The Esoterican Arms|underground pub]]. He'll give you a [[mining prop]].\n*Head up north, and you will see two [[dwarf]] miners. Pick up a [[pickaxe]] from the rock if you need one.\n*Use the mining prop on the crevice.\n*Squeeze through the crevice.\n\nNow, you need to repair the lift using items found in the boxes in the chamber:\n#First, take an [[engine]] and three [[beam]]s, three [[pulley beam]]s, and two [[rope]]s from the crates.\n#Before you start assembling the whole structure, add five chunks of [[coal]] to the engine. ''If you did not bring coal with you, the chamber has four coal rocks as well as a pickaxe near the dwarves if you forgot one.''\n#Use a pulley beam on the broken scaffold on the east side of the room to attach it.\n#Use a beam on a pulley beam to make a [[long pulley beam]], and then use it with another beam to get a [[longer pulley beam]], which you must attach to the scaffold.\n#Use the final pulley beam on the scaffold.\n#Use the rope on the scaffold to wind it through the pulleys.\n#Use the third beam on the ''platform'' to repair it.\n#Place the engine on the ''engine platform''.\n\nThe lift should be operational now, so grab another rope from the crate and 'use-lift' on the platform to head closer to the mysteries of the island. (If this option doesn't appear, make sure you have added 5 coal to the engine. You can do it when placed on the engine platform)\n\n===The burnt diary===\n*Take the [[plank]] and enter the tunnel. Travel east and use a [[rope]] with the overhanging rock to get across the water.\n*You will come across the remains of a fire, search it to get the first part of a [[burnt diary]]. Read the diary, and save it for later.\n*Use the plank to cross the slippery rocks - otherwise, you may be hit for 8 damage. The plank is not left behind and may be reused.\n*As you proceed further into the caves, you will come across two more fire remains, search them to get the second and third part of the diary. After the third fire remain, there will be some vents in the ground. '''Do not walk across or stand on them as they repeatedly damage you depending on your Hitpoints level.''' \n*After the vents, there will be another fire remain, search it for the fourth part of the diary. Going further down into the caves, there will be some rocks lying on the cliffs above your path, '''do not stand or walk under those rocks as they will fall down on you and deal some damage depending on your Hitpoints level.''' \n*After progressing through the area with the rocks, you will come across yet another fire remain. Search it to find the fifth and final page for the diary. Once you have completed the [[Burnt diary|diary]], you must read it before being able to enter a crevice at the end of the passage.\n\n===Those meddling kids!===\n*Enter through the crevice, and you should see a cutscene involving some lost kids. The kids had apparently not been able to pass the trials to become a [[Fremennik]], so they were going to start a war here and then stop it, and be seen as heroes. They are to blame for everything. When it's done, talk to them; they will let you know that you need to fight a sea snake.\n*Travel out through the next exit, and roam the passages where there are lots of sea snakes and snake spawns until you reach another crevice; squeeze through and kill the [[Giant Sea Snake]] (level 149).\n\n===The final battle===\n[[File:Royal Trouble boss fight.png|thumb|250px|A player fighting the Giant Sea Snake.]]\n[[Protect from Melee]] works fine ([[Protect from Missiles]] if [[Ranged|ranging]] or [[Magic|maging]]), but its [[poison]] damage hits 9 so an [[antipoison]] is '''strongly''' recommended. Pick up the box that it drops. If you forget to collect the box before leaving, speak to the guard outside the dungeon on Etceteria. After the fight, it is also recommended to immediately drink your antipoison because the damage of the poison is very slow, yet heavy.\n*Return through the crevice. A guard will notice you and help you up, and you will surface near Sigrid's castle.\n*Go to [[Queen Sigrid]] and talk to her, she'll be impressed with you, and she'll give you 20,000 coins as a reward and a [[Letter (Royal Trouble)|letter]] to take to [[King Vargas]] (reading it will not affect the quest).\n*Talk to King Vargas to give him the letter for your reward.

Agree to help him, and refuse the money he offers you. He will knock you out and take you to [[Braindeath Island]].\n\nUpon waking, you will find yourself in a small room. Talk to [[Captain Braindeath]], and he will tell you that he needs to make some \"rum\" in order to get [[Captain Donnie]] drunk. You will have to gather the ingredients to make the rum. The Captain will give you some [[Blindweed seed|seeds]] in order to grow the first ingredient.\n\n===Brewing \"rum\"===\n====Blindweed====\n[[File:Rum Deal Hopper.png|thumb|220px|The hopper is in the north-west corner.]]\nIf you brought a [[rake]] and a [[seed dibber]], you can skip this. ''The first ingredient is [[blindweed]]. Go down the ladder in the north-west corner of the building, and then, head south-east to find a cupboard. Take everything from the cupboard (this is equipment for you to farm your [[Blindweed seed|seed]]) '''except''' the [[watering can]], which you don't need, and return to the main floor.''\n[[File:Rum Deal - kitten censor.png|thumb|220px|\"We interrupt this insult to bring you this soothing picture of a kitten. Normal service will be resumed shortly. Thank you for your patience.\"]]\nLeave the building by the southernmost stairway. Walk south until you find some [[farming patches]]. The majority of them will be unusable; the southeastern one will still be available, however. Rake away the weeds, and plant your seed (requires 40 [[Farming]]). Wait for the blindweed to grow (about five minutes; you will receive a notification that says \"''I wonder how my Blindweed is coming along?''\" upon completion) and pick it. During this time, you may be attacked by [[zombie swab]]s; find a convenient [[safespot]], such as the other side of the fence, and choose the right-click option \"intimidate\" to stop them from attacking you. You only have to scare each swab once.\n\nReturn to [[Captain Braindeath]], and he will tell you to put the blindweed in the hopper. Use the southeastern ladder to go up one floor and use the blindweed with the hopper, in the northwestern corner next to the pressure barrel. Ignore the pressure barrel and the lever; you just have to put it in the hopper. Return to Captain Braindeath to find the next ingredient.\n\n====Stagnant water====\n[[File:Rum Deal - stagnant lake.png|thumb|220px|A player collects a bucket of stagnant water.]]\nTo get [[Bucket of water (Rum Deal)|stagnant water]], you will have to travel to a nearby volcano and fill a [[bucket]], which the [[Captain Braindeath|captain]] has given you. Leave the house via the south stairway again and travel north-west (make sure you're on the outside of the fence first) to find [[50% Luke]] guarding a small gate. Open the gate and walk through - you will automatically make a diversion for the guard. Travel up the volcano and collect some stagnant water. Return to the house (a shortcut is to use your [[Ectophial]] and talk to [[Pirate Pete]] again),\u00a0put the water in the hopper, and talk to [[Captain Braindeath]].\n\n====Sluglings====\n[[File:Rum Deal - fishing sluglings.png|thumb|220px|A player uses the fishbowl and net to catch sluglings.]]\nThe [[Captain Braindeath|captain]] will give you a [[Fishbowl and net|fishbowl tangled in a big net]] and tell you to fish five \"[[sluglings]]\". '''Don't untangle the bowl and net!''' If you do, use one on the other to \"retangle\" them. Head to the farming patch you used earlier; the [[fishing spots]] are close by. Fish five sea creatures (you may get fish other than sluglings, such as a [[Karamthulhu]]; you can use those too). Return to the house, but instead of putting the sea creatures directly into the hopper, you will have to \"pressurise\" them; put them in the pressure barrel (next to the hopper) and pull the lever. Then, return to [[Captain Braindeath]].\n\n====Evil spirits====\n:'''Note:''' If you wish to have multiple [[holy wrench]]es, you can use the [[Drop trick]] here to get them from [[Captain Braindeath]] and then go bless them.\n[[File:Holy Wrench.png|thumb|220px|Blessing the Wrench, with multiple Holy Wrenches on the ground.]]\nCaptain Braindeath will tell you that the controls for the brewery have become possessed. He will give you a wrench in order to beat the controls with it. Head to the west side of the house and get your wrench blessed by [[Davey]] - he will only bless the wrench if you have 47 or more Prayer points, not just level 47 in [[Prayer]]. (Note that this does '''NOT''' take away your [[prayer points]].) Now, beat the controls (located directly south of Captain Braindeath - it is the machine that is spinning uncontrollably) with it, and a level 150 [[Evil spirit]] will appear, you can easily [[safespot]] with [[Ranged]]/[[Magic]], or use a [[halberd]] behind the pylons to kill it.\n\n====Fever spider====\n'''''Recommended item:''' [[Slayer gloves]]''\n\n[[Captain Braindeath]] will tell you that the final ingredient is the carcass of a [[fever spider]].\n\n'''Do not underestimate the spider as it hits consistent 9s at 70 defence without slayer gloves. Remember to protect from melee. '''\n\nGo down the ladder near Captain Braindeath and kill a fever spider - be warned that if you do not wear [[Slayer gloves]], you may become [[diseased]], but if you are [[maging]] or [[ranging]] the spiders, you can hide behind the ladder/boxes and attack one; you will not become diseased if you do this. [[Protect from Melee]] '''cannot''' be used to prevent the disease. Collect its carcass, use it with the hopper, and talk to Captain Braindeath.\n\n===Captain Donnie===\nNow that the \"rum\" is complete, collect some from the \"output tap\" at the south end of the machinery with a [[bucket]]. If you dropped the bucket he gave you for the stagnant water, he will give you another one. Head outside to the [[farming patches]]. Find [[Captain Donnie]], and give him the \"rum\". After some dialogue, he will tell you the name of his boss.

This is a reference to ''{{WP|The Exorcist}}''.\n*Part of [[Davey]]'s blessing is \"Romanes Eunt Domus\" (which is rough Latin for \"Romans go home\") and is a reference to Monty Python's ''{{WP|Life of Brian}}''.\n*The other type of fish you can catch besides sluglings is called [[Karamthulhu]]. This is another in-game reference to {{WP|H. P. Lovecraft}}'s {{WP|Cthulhu}}, which is described as having tentacles as a main physical feature.\n*When you have Davey bless your [[Holy wrench|wrench]], the camera will zoom in on your character. Once that happens, your character will hold up the wrench and say \"Groovy.\" This is a reference to the 1981 film ''{{WP|Evil Dead}}'' and sequel ''{{WP|Evil Dead 2}}'' when the main character Ash cuts his own possessed hand off and replaces it with a chainsaw.\n*When attacking the [[Evil spirit]], your character will say: \"The power of Guthix compels you!\" this is also a reference to the movie ''{{WP|The Exorcist}}'', where the priest yells: \"The power of Christ compels you!\".\n*When you talk to [[50% Luke]] and ask \"So what goes on here?\", he says \"You expect me to talk?\" to which you reply \"No Mr Luke, I expect you to die\". This is a reference to the James Bond film ''{{WP|Goldfinger}}''.\n*If you try to pull the pressure lever, without putting in the five sea creatures, you will get the message: \"You do not yet have the five sea creatures in the barrel!\" even if you haven't got the message from [[Captain Braindeath]].\n*One of the lines that the zombie pirates say is \"United we stagger.\" this is a reference to the US saying, \"United we stand.\"\n*When getting a bucket of 'rum', a message will appear ''\"you carefully fill the bucket with the foul-smelling swill.\"'' When examining the bucket with 'rum', it says ''\"sorry, I mean a bucket of 'rum'\"''.\n*When speaking to 50% Luke, asking him \"So how flammable are you?\", he will reply, \"Don't make me angry! Ye'll not like me when I'm angry\"; this is a reference to the Incredible Hulk when Bruce Banner tells Jack McGee, \"Mr. McGee, don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.\"\n*The quest title ''Rum Deal'' may be a reference to the phrase ''Bum Deal'', when somebody gets the poor end of the deal where the player has lots of menial tasks to complete.\n*When examining the Evil spirit, it states \"The pun was intended.\" referring to 'spirit' being another term for alcohol.\n\n{{Rum Deal}}"], "Rune Mysteries": ["{{External|rs=Rune Mysteries (historical)}}\n{{Floor}}\n{{Has quick guide}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Rune Mysteries\n|number = 51\n|image = [[File:Rune Mysteries.png|300px]]\n|members = No\n|release = 1 December [[2003]]\n|update = RuneScape 2 Beta is Here!\n|series = None\n|difficulty = Novice\n|developer = James B\n}}\n'''Rune Mysteries''' is a novice level [[Free-to-play]] [[quest]], and a requirement for mining [[rune essence]] within the [[Rune Essence mine]].\n{{Clear}}\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Speak to [[Duke Horacio]] on the {{FloorNumber|2}} of [[Lumbridge Castle]].\n|difficulty = Novice\n|description = Recent research at the Wizards' Tower has found a way to create Runes for the first time in centuries.

'''Make sure you have spoken to the Seer before you attempt to catch this scorpion; otherwise, you will not be able to push the false wall.'''\n[[File:Scorpion Catcher - First scorpion location.png|thumb|240px|The location of the first Kharidian scorpion.]]\nIf you have level 80 [[Agility]], use the shortcut to the [[poison spider]]s or If you have level 70 [[Agility]], use the [[shortcut]] to the [[blue dragon]]s; otherwise, walk around and use the dusty key on the gate to blue dragons. (If you need to acquire a dusty key, follow the track towards the [[Black Knights' Base]] and kill the [[jailer]] located in the eastern area of the base, who will drop a [[jail key]]. Use the jail key on the door of the cell containing [[Velrak the explorer]]. Speak to him; ask if there are any good places to explore, and when he asks you if you want to go further into the dungeon, say yes and he will give you a dusty key.)\nThen, go south of the dragons and west to the [[black demon]]s; then, go north to where the [[poison spider]]s are. It should be fairly easy to spot a small room nearby with a false wall you can push at the south of the two coffins. Use the [[scorpion cage]] on the small scorpion inside this room to catch it (if you try to pick it up, it will sting you for 3 damage).\n\n===The second scorpion===\n[[File:Scorpion Catcher - Second scorpion location.png|thumb|240px|The location of the second Kharidian scorpion.]]\nReturning to the [[Seer]] will reveal the location of the second and third scorpion. He will hint to a [[Peksa|merchant]] in [[Barbarian Village]], [[Peksa]] will say he left it in the bed of a relative as a surprise gift while visiting; it's actually in the [[Barbarian Outpost]] (use a [[games necklace]] to teleport there). The scorpion is wandering around the grounds just inside the entrance of the [[Agility training]] arena. To get in, you'll have to have completed [[Alfred Grimhand's Barcrawl]]. You can head back to the [[Seer]] to get the location of the third and final scorpion if you've forgotten.\n\n===The third scorpion===\n[[File:Scorpion Catcher - Third scorpion location.png|thumb|left|230px|The location of the third Kharid Scorpion.]]\nThe last scorpion is in the [[Edgeville Monastery]] on the {{FloorNumber|2}}; go up the southeastern ladder (either use a [[combat bracelet]] to teleport directly there or use an [[amulet of glory]] to teleport to [[Edgeville]] and walk west) and use your cage on the scorpion to catch it.\n\nIf you have never visited the monastery, you need to speak with [[Abbot Langley]] beforehand. You'll need to have 31 [[Prayer]] to go upstairs.\n\n===Finishing up===\nFinally, bring the full [[scorpion cage]] to [[Thormac]].\n\n'''Congratulations!

She will tell you her husband, [[Kent]], and her son, [[Kennith]], are missing and ask you to go to the [[Fishing Platform]] to find them. [[Holgart]] has a boat that he can maybe take you in.\n\nTalk to Holgart, and he will tell you his ship is in need of repairs. He will ask you to go and get him one [[swamp paste]] to fix it up. The best way to get swamp paste is to buy it directly from the [[Grand Exchange]]. Alternatively, you could go to the [[general store]] in [[Port Khazard]], located south of Ardougne - a guaranteed source. Once you give him the swamp paste, Holgart will appear in a cut scene fixing the boat. Talk to him again to go to the Fishing Platform.\n\n'''Note''': You cannot use [[swamp tar]]. However, you can mix swamp tar with [[flour]] and cook it on a [[fire]] (does '''NOT''' work on a [[range]]) to create swamp paste.\n\n===Investigate===\n[[File:Sea Slug - Speaking with bailey.png|thumb|226px|Talking to Bailey.]]\nWhen you arrive, you will notice the odd behaviour of everyone as they all seem to be in a zombie-like trance.

He will ask you to find his father, [[Kent]] and help him.\n\nGo back to [[Holgart]] and talk to him. He will take you to a deserted island, where you will find Kennith's father stranded. Talk to Kent and he will tell you his story. Then ask Holgart to take you back to the platform. Talk to [[Bailey]] to find out the slugs' weakness - they are afraid of heat. He will give you an [[unlit torch]], which he cannot light it himself as it is too damp. Use the [[broken glass]] on the [[damp sticks]], which are found near the ladder\u00a0to [[Dry sticks|dry them]], then rub them together to light the torch. \n\n[[File:Sea Slug - Rescuing Kennith.png|thumb|201px|Using the crane to save Kennith.]]\nClimb up the ladder again (on the north-east of the platform), go into the room, and talk to Kennith.

However, a regular hammer is insufficient to build the temple without a large group. An additional 13,000 coins allows you to buy a [[Flamtaer hammer]], which is all but necessary to complete this part of the [[quest]].\n'''Optional but recommended:'''\n*2 or 3 [[tarromin]] herbs, [[ashes]], and spare [[logs]]\n*[[Druid pouch]] (only if travelling through the swamp with [[ghast]]s)\n*3 or 4 [[Flamtaer bracelet]]s (HIGHLY recommended; the minigame is usually unpopulated)\n*[[Flamtaer hammer]] (HIGHLY recommended; the minigame is usually unpopulated)\n*[[Food]]\n|kills = 5 [[Loar Shade]]s ''(level 40)''\n|recommended = \n}}\n\n==Walkthrough==\n[[File:Quest start shades of mort'ton.png|thumb|150px|Where to start the quest.]]\n===Getting to Mort'ton===\nMake sure you have all the items you need '''BEFORE''' you go to Mort'ton. It's a really long walk to get to the [[bank]] from there unless you have done the quest [[In Aid of the Myreque]] and have repaired the bank in [[Burgh de Rott]].\n\nThe quickest way to Mort'ton is with the use of [[Mort'ton teleport|Mort'ton teleport scrolls]]. Alternatively if you have access to [[Fairy rings]], taking the ring with code {{Fairycode|bkr}} and running to the boat at [[The Hollows]] will be your second quickest option. If you are 50 [[Agility]] or higher, take the ring with code {{Fairycode|bip}} and use the hopping stone to the swamp. Another option is to use a Barrows teleport tablet, then run west. Also you can use a barrow teleport and head west to Mort'ton.\n\nIn the absence of the above three methods; to get to Mort'ton, head west out of [[Canifis]] until you see a [[Farming/Patch locations|farming patch]]. Head a bit south and through the gate to get to [[Mort Myre Swamp]]. From here, head west to the river, and simply hug it, proceeding south until you hit a bridge. Simply follow the path until you hit Mort'ton, ignoring the two dead ends along the way.\n\n===Starting the quest===\nIn order to start Shades of Mort'ton, you must head to the most southwestern house in Mort'ton and search the shelf on the wall to find a [[Diary (Shades of Mort'ton)|book]]. '''You should also search the smashed table, as it contains two [[Tarromin]] and [[Rogue's purse]].''' The Tarromin will allow you to create additional potions later on, so hang onto those. The Rogue's purse is not used in this quest, and can safely be dropped.\n\n===Serum 207 and killing shades===\n'''''Items required:''' 300+ [[coins]], [[vial of water]], [[tarromin]], [[ashes]], [[food]], [[armour]], and a [[weapon]].''\n\nReading the book will now allow you to create [[Serum 207]], a combination of a water-filled [[vial]], [[tarromin]] and [[ashes]]. Using Serum 207 on the afflicted in town (those with specific names) will allow you to speak with them '''momentarily'''. Having multiple sets of the ingredients will allow you to create more potions if necessary, so it is recommended to bring multiple sets. Serum 207 may be traded, but you must make at least one yourself in order to use it for the purposes of the quest.\n\nMake a Serum 207 (add ashes to a [[Tarromin potion (unf)]]), and use it on [[Razmire Keelgan]] in the [[general store]]. Razmire will ask you to kill 5 [[Loar Shade]]s (the level 40 green shadows) and collect their [[Loar remains|remains]]. You must talk to Razmire '''before''' you kill five shades otherwise they will not count towards the requirement. You must also kill the five shades yourself, you '''cannot''' buy five remains off another player. When you're done (there will be a notice in the chat), return and use the Serum 207 on Razmire again, and he will take two of the shade remains from you.\n\nOpen the general store through Razmire and buy some [[olive oil]]. Then ask him to open the builders store, and buy at least one [[timber beam]], one [[limestone brick]], and five [[swamp paste]] per timber/limestone.\n\nNow, proceed to [[Ulsquire Shauncy]]. He can be found in the house to the south-east, marked on the minimap as containing a water source. Give him a dose of Serum 207, and then one of your [[shade remains]]. Talk to him again, and ask what he learned about them; he will joke about rebuilding the temple and experimenting with the sacred flame. Also, ask him what can he tell you about the temple, which is located northeast of the general store, on a small island.\n\n===Repairing the Temple===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[hammer]], [[olive oil]], [[limestone brick]], [[timber beam]], [[swamp paste]], [[food]], [[armour]], a [[Weapons|weapon]], a [[tinderbox]], [[logs]], [[loar remains]], and 1+ [[Serum 207|doses of Serum 207]]. A [[Flamtaer hammer]] and a few [[Flamtaer bracelet|Flamtaer bracelets]] are recommended.''\n\nNow, you must rebuild the temple in order to create the sacred oil needed for a pyre funeral. A [[Flamtaer bracelet]] along with the [[Flamtaer hammer]] will allow you to build the temple <u>on your own</u>. It is recommended to bring at least two or three bracelets to build the temple if attempting this solo. A higher [[Crafting]] level will also increase the speed of building and repairing the temple.\n\nWorld 377 is a dedicated world for rebuilding the temple if you're looking for assistance. This part of the quest can be finished much quicker when there are multiple players building the temple. Five or six players, with two or three\u00a0building the walls and\u00a0the rest distracting shades from destroying the walls should make for a successful build within a few minutes. \n\nUsing the forums, the [[Minigame Group Finder]], or doing the quest with friends are possible ways to find other players who can help repair the temple. Peak activity at the [[Shades of Mort'ton (minigame)|Shades of Mort'ton]] minigame is typically between 12:00 pm and 3:00 pm EST (4:00 pm to 7:00 pm GMT). It may be difficult to find other players using the Minigame Group Finder outside of these times.\n\nWhile defending/repairing the temple, you will receive a gradually increasing percentage of '''Sanctity'''. Sanctity is earned by killing [[Loar Shade]]s or using your building materials to build/repair pieces of the temple.\n\nIn order to progress the quest, ignite the flame once the temple has been built and combine the [[olive oil]] with the sacred flame to create [[sacred oil]]. You will need 10% Sanctity to do this, which should be easily obtained during the temple build.\n\nIf you wish to cure the [[afflicted]] citizens of the town permanently (useful for the general store), use a vial of [[Serum 207]] on the sacred flame with 20% Sanctity to create [[Serum 208]]. It is strongly recommended to use a dose of Serum 208 on both [[Razmire]] and [[Ulsquire]] to cure their affliction permanently.\n[[File:Burning shade remains.gif|frame|right|The Shade spirit is now free!]]\nAfter you obtain the sacred oil, cut down a [[dead tree]], and use sacred oil on the [[logs]] to receive a [[pyre logs|pyre log]]. Then, head over to one of the funeral pyres, which are the brown patches on the map west of the General Store. Use the pyre logs on the funeral pyre, followed by the [[Loar remains]]. Light this and you will see a spirit rise from the pyre. \n\nCollect your reward from the stone pillar next to the pyre and head back to Ulsquire. Speak with him to prompt the end of the quest (use a serum if he has reverted to being afflicted). \n\n'''Congratulations!

If you do not have a regular [[Silverlight]], he will give you an uncoloured Silverlight free of charge. '''If you already have a dyed Silverlight, bank the extra Silverlight.''' After you start, go to [[Uzer]] past the [[Shantay Pass]] south of Al Kharid. (If you'd like, you can use the nearby [[fairy ring]] {{Fairycode|DLQ}}). Be sure to bring your Silverlight with you since you won't be able to continue without it. (You can take a [[magic carpet]] there for 75 - 200 [[coins]] depending on whether or not you have the [[ring of charos]] and whether or not you've played the [[Rogue Trader]] game before.) After arriving in Uzer, talk to [[Father Badden]] - be sure to talk to him about all your options. Afterwards, enter the dungeon.\n\nWhen you try to enter the demon's lair, [[Evil Dave]] won't let you by because you aren't evil enough.\nYou need to wear at least three items of black clothing. There are a number of ways to achieve this, including:\n[[File:Shadow of the Storm - black mushrooms.png|thumb|220px|A black mushroom near the entrance.]]\n*Dying a [[desert shirt]] and a [[desert robe]] black by picking a [[black mushroom]] outside of the dungeon and grinding it into [[black mushroom ink]].\n*Wearing any three [[black armour]] items.

Evil Dave will take you to the leader of the group, [[Denath]]. He will tell you that he needs your help to summon [[Agrith-Naar]], since [[Josef]] left. '''He will tell you the incantation to use, which is different for everyone, so you need to write it down.'''\n[[File:Shadow of the Storm - Evil Dave introduces player.png|thumb|220px|Evil Dave introduces their newest dark wizard, you, to Denath.]]\nTalk to [[Jennifer]] to get a [[demonic sigil mould]]. Go to Al Kharid, and make a [[demonic sigil]] with your [[silver bar]] (if you are using fairy rings, the furnace in Zanaris may be faster). You can use this to chant the incantation with the group.\n\n'''You no longer need your black equipment to enter the portal. If you need to gear up for the fight, save a trip and bring what you need.'''\n\nGo back to the demon's lair and talk to [[Matthew]]. He will tell you to find the book that [[Josef]] dropped in order to defeat the demon. Talk to the [[Golem]]\u2014he will tell you that Denath killed Josef, but not before Josef hid the book in one of the kilns. '''You must talk to the golem before you can search the kilns!''' In Uzer, search the kilns that are outside until you find a [[Demonic Tome]]. (Don't forget the one north of the magic carpet, and the one east of the temple. There are '''four (4)''' in total.)\n\nYou'll find a book. Read it; then, return through the portal '''(with the book, because Matthew will ask you if he can read it as well)''', and discuss the content with Matthew. Strangely enough, the incantation for summoning the demon that's written in the book is backwards to the one that Denath told you to say. This is likely due to the fact that the incantation in the book is one to seal away the demon (backwards) while the one Denath told you was to summon the demon (forward).\n[[File:Shadow of the Storm - Denath teleports away.png|thumb|220px|Denath walks into the centre of the circle, teleporting away!]]\nWhen you have finished, Denath will call you over to lead the incantation. Using your sigil, chant it in the order that he told you. (If you have forgotten, it is in the book but backwards.) Suddenly, Denath will walk into the centre of the circle and go into another dimension. Denath was Agrith-Naar all along, and you actually desummoned him by saying the incantation ''backwards''. This particular demon is much more powerful in his own dimension, so you need to get more people back in the circle and resummon him to defeat him!\n[[File:Shadow of the Storm - Tanya is killed.png|thumb|220px|Tanya is killed by ghosts during her attempt to flee.]]\nPick up the sigil that Denath dropped. '''(If you don't, you will have to make another one.)''' Evil Dave, [[Eric]], and [[Tanya]] will have run away, so chase after them through the portal. Tanya will get killed by ghosts, so take her sigil. Eric will be killed by a falling stone. Tell Evil Dave that he needs to return to the lair. He will give you Eric's sigil then return to the lair. Exit the dungeon. Father Badden and Father Reen will both be there, so give them each a sigil upon calling one of them simple-minded due to his apparent reluctance, and tell them to go to the demon's lair. Talk to the [[Clay Golem]]. He was programmed to never help summon demons, so go back into the dungeon, take the [[strange implement]], use it on the golem, and take out the scroll about demons. Talk to the golem again, who will agree to help you.\n\n'''<span style=\"color:red\">WARNING:</span> If you are to die during the boss battle, all items not [[kept upon death]] will disappear. Do not risk any items you are not willing to lose! (It is possible to teleport out during the fight to avoid dying.)'''\nBack in the demon's lair, go into the circle, and talk to Matthew to get everyone to stand in the circle. Then, chant the incantation with your sigil in the order that you read in the book (the opposite order that you chanted it in last time). Agrith-Naar will appear, very angry that you summoned him. He will kill Matthew, then attack you.\n[[File:Shadow of the Storm - Agrith-Naar resummoned.png|thumb|220px|Agrith-Naar is resummoned!]]\n\nAgrith-Naar is level 100. By default, he casts [[Fire Blast]] at a distance and uses both [[Melee]] and Fire Blast up close. If you use [[prayer]], he'll automatically use the attack that you don't [[Protection prayers|protect from]]. However, you can potentially have full protection by using the protection from magic prayer and standing two squares away from Agrith-Naar. If you are standing two or more squares away, he will telegrab you within his melee attack, but you can prevent continuous melee attacks by repeatedly moving back and hoping he continues to attack with fire blast.\n[[File:Fighting Agrith-Naar.png|thumb|240px|The player battles Agrith-Naar.]]\nYou must hit the final blow with Silverlight in order to win the fight. '''It is not possible to hit the last blow with any other weapon than Silverlight.

The general store in [[Ardougne]] sells balls of wool.\n\nHead to Fred the Farmer and talk to him. Tell him you're looking for a [[quest]].

This choice is important for two reasons:\n* You need a member of the opposite gang to cooperate with you in order to complete this quest.*\n* This choice will show up for future\u00a0quests\u00a0if you decide to become a\u00a0member. Most notably, the\u00a0Heroes' Quest\u00a0has gang related activities where item trading between both gangs is also an important feature.\n* If you are a\u00a0skiller/skill pure, you can choose the\u00a0Black Arm Gang, and have your partner from the Phoenix gang drop-trick the [[weapon store key]] while talking to [[Straven]] to get a duplicate, and have them give that key to you. Then you can both enter the store room and they can kill the [[weaponmaster]] while you get the crossbows.\nBeing a member of the\u00a0Phoenix Gang\u00a0is recommended if a player has lower\u00a0combat levels, or is a skill pure.\n\nChoosing the Black Arm gang is favourable as it makes the overall process quicker and easier for you as there are many more Phoenix members to match up with. \n\nIf your partner has combined the two half pieces to create the complete certificate or has completed the quest, they cannot obtain the half piece of the shield from their gang hideout - which means certificates cannot be obtained from them. If your partner is from Phoenix Gang, they can help you acquire the key to the weapon store only.\n\nTo find a partner for the quest, it is recommended to check the ''[[Old School RuneScape]]'' [[forums]]. There is an official [[clan chat]], ''Osrs Soa'', which can be used for finding another partner for this quest, in addition to [[Heroes' Quest]]. It's recommended to put off joining a gang until you can find a partner!\n\n'''Warning:''' Although the majority of players in the ''OSRS SoA'' clan chat offer their services for free, some players also charge [[coins|in-game money]]. Players should always be aware of the possibility of getting [[scams|scammed]] when engaging in [[scams#Trust trading scams|trust trades]] with other players.\n\n==Walkthrough==\n===Shared starting===\n'''''Items required:''' None.''\n[[File:Reldo chathead.png|left]]\nNote: '''If you wish to join the Black Arm Gang, you can start the quest by simply talking to Charlie the Tramp and asking what is down the alley.'''\n\nTalk to [[Reldo]], located in [[Varrock]]'s library, in [[Varrock Palace]]. Ask him for a quest, and he will tell you there is probably a book on something in the library. You have to now check the bookcase with a blue book in the top shelf. When you've found it, read or skim through it. After you've read the book, speak with Reldo and ask him about the whereabouts of the [[Phoenix Gang]], but he tells you to go to [[Baraek]], the fur trader in [[Varrock Square]], because he doesn't know.\n\nAt this stage, you can either join the Phoenix Gang or the [[Black Arm Gang]]. If you wish to join the Phoenix Gang, speak to Baraek. Otherwise, talk to [[Charlie the Tramp]], next to the southern gate of Varrock.\n\n[[Ironmen]] can save 7708 [[coins]] while doing the [[Heroes' Quest]] later by picking the [[Phoenix Gang]].\n\n===Phoenix Gang===\n'''''Items required:''' 20 [[coins]], and a weapon (optional but recommended). ''\n\n[[Baraek]] is located in the centre of [[Varrock]]. '''(To join the [[Black Arm Gang]], go talk to [[Charlie the Tramp]].)''' He buys and sells furs, and his stall is marked with an icon of bear fur. Talk to him and ask about the [[Phoenix Gang]]. At first, he will refuse, then he will want you to give him 20 coins for info. Give him 20 coins, and he will tell you it is located in the south-east corner of Varrock. '''Ask him all the questions available.'''\n\n[[Phoenix Gang Hideout|The hideout]] is near the south-east corner of Varrock between the two bars. It is a bit south of the rune [[shop]]. Look for a red exclamation mark (on your map) to find the hideout. When you've found the red exclamation mark, you will see a ladder. Climb down it to enter the Phoenix Gang's hideout.\n[[File:Shield of Arrav - Phoenix Gang hideout location.png|thumb|161x161px|The entrance to the Phoenix Gang hideout.]]\n\nInside the hideout, talk to [[Straven]]. If you ask to join, he will mention the Varrock Herald [[newspaper]]. This is a cover up. There should be an option to tell him that you '''''know who he is''''', a member of the Phoenix Gang.\n\nStraven will want you to kill [[Jonny the beard]] ([[combat level]] 2). He is located in Varrock's [[Blue Moon Inn]]. This bar is located near the south entrance of Varrock. Go inside the bar and find Jonny the Beard and kill him. Note that killing him with a [[ring of recoil]] won't make him drop anything.\n\nJonny will drop a [[Intel report|report]], which Straven needs. Grab the report and bring it back to Straven. Talk to Straven while having the report in your inventory, and he will make you a Phoenix Gang member, allowing you to enter their hideout. Straven will also give you the [[Weapon store key]], which you need to save for your partner. The thieves walking around are not aggressive to any players, but will retaliate if you attack them.\n\nLook around for a chest in the south-west corner of the hideout to find one half of the [[Broken shield|Shield of Arrav]]. You can only grab one shield at a time, and you can no longer obtain it after completing the quest.\n\n===Black Arm Gang===\n'''''Items required:''' food and a weapon (both optional but recommended).''\n[[File:Charlie the Tramp chathead.png|left]]\n[[File:Shield of Arrav - Black Arm Gang hideout location.png|thumb|161x161px|The entrance to the Black Arm Gang hideout.]]\nTo join the [[Black Arm Gang]], talk to [[Charlie the Tramp]] located near the south entrance of [[Varrock]]. Ask him what's down the alley, and he'll tell you that it's the Black Arm Gang's hideout. Go down the alley and enter the building. Look for a woman named [[Katrine]] and talk to her.\n\nTell her you know about her gang and that you won't give your source. Ask her about what you should do to prove that you're trustworthy, and she will give you a task to join her gang.\n\nKatrine wants you to steal from the [[Phoenix Gang]]. She wants two of their crossbows. However, you will need a partner in the Phoenix Gang for this part of the quest. Your partner must give you the [[Weapon store key]] they obtained when they joined the Phoenix Gang. Once you have the key, go toward the Phoenix Gang's hideout in the south-east corner of Varrock between the two pubs. Look for a small room directly south of the rune shop with a locked door and a ladder visible inside. When you've found it, use the key with the door and climb up the ladder.\n\nYou will have to kill the [[Weaponsmaster]] on this floor. If you try to pick up the crossbow without killing the Weaponsmaster first, he will prevent you from doing so. Once he is dead, take two [[Phoenix crossbow]]s. When you have both of them, go back to Katrine, and she will make you a member of the Black Arm Gang. Go upstairs in the hideout and look for a cupboard, which contains one half of the [[Broken shield|Shield of Arrav]].\n\n'''Note: If you are worried about the battle, you can ask your partner to kill the Weaponsmaster himself and simply trade the Phoenix crossbows to you.'''\n\n===Finishing up===\n'''''Items required:''' Shield of Arrav half''\n\nTake your half of the shield to [[Curator Haig Halen]], located in the [[Varrock Museum]]. He will take your half of the shield and give you two copies of [[Half certificate|half the certificate]]. Your partner, who has the other half of the Shield, will receive the other half of the certificate. Trade one half of the certificate with your partner for the other half. When you have both certificate halves, use them on the other to obtain a completed [[Certificate (Shield of Arrav)|certificate]].   [[File:Shield of Arrav - Certificate.png|centre]]\n\nTake the certificate to [[King Roald]] in the castle to receive your reward. Quest complete.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Shield of Arrav\n|image = [[File:Shield of Arrav reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n*600 [[coins]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n*If a player cannot find someone to trade the certificates with, they cannot finish the quest.\n*If a Phoenix Gang member tries to talk to Katrine, she spits on them and does not allow them to join the gang.\n*A Black Arm Gang member can enter the Phoenix Gang Weapon Storage with a key from a Phoenix Gang member.\n*Phoenix crossbows can be obtained by Phoenix gang members by going into the weapon store and telekinetic grabbing them. However, the crossbows must be traded to a Black Arm gang member in order to gain trust to Katrine.\n*If working with additional players who want to get the half of a certificate from you, it would be wise to take the half certificates to the bank, store them, grab another shield half from your respective gang house and present it to the Curator. There is no practical limit to how many certificate halves you can have, but it is a tedious process going back and forth to the Curator and the gang stronghold. '''Note: Once you combine both halves of the certificates in your inventory you can no longer get spare shields.''' You can have only one shield half in your inventory at any given time. Also, keep in mind that once you have completed this quest, you can no longer obtain the shield half any more, although you can continue to keep certificate halves in your bank account indefinitely after you have completed the quest or trade for them with other players.\n*If completing the quest as an [[Ironman]] you must 'use' the key/certificate on each other\n\n==Trivia==\n*Shield of Arrav was one of the 6 quests available during ''RuneScape'''s launch.\n*Once a player finishes the quest, they can no longer take any halves of the shield from their storage places. However, players can still acquire the halves of the shield from other players (via trading, drops, or general stores).\n*In the beginning, a bug allowed the player to join both gangs. Katrine would appear angry at the player, but the player would still be able to enter the Black Arm Gang. The Phoenix gang doorman would also attack the player.\n*In the early days, entering the Phoenix Gang's headquarters required a separate key. This was later changed, and the key was removed from the game.\n*The shield is currently on display (display number 24) at the [[Varrock museum|Varrock Museum]] after you speak to the curator on the second floor and tell him how you recovered the shield for the museum.\n*Before the shield is put onto display in the [[Varrock museum|Varrock Museum]], it mentions \"King Roald has offered a 1,200gp bounty for the reward of the shield and we keep this display case empty in the hopes it will one day be returned.\" However, King Roald rewards the adventurer only 600gp for quest completion - half of the advertised offer from the display case. This is probably due to the fact that your partner gets the other half.\n\n== Required for completing ==\n* [[Heroes' Quest]]\n\n{{Shield of Arrav}}\n[[Category:Varrock]]\n[[Category:Shield of Arrav]]"], "Shilo Village": ["{{External|rs|rsc=Shilo Village (quest)}}\n{{otheruses|the quest|the village|Shilo Village (location)}}\n{{Has quick guide}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Shilo Village\n|number = 41\n|image = [[File:Shilo Village.png|300px]]\n|members = Yes\n|release = 27 January [[2003]]\n|update = Shilo Village Quest online\n|series = [[List of quest series#Karamja series|Karamja]]\n|difficulty = Experienced\n|developer = Tytn H\n}}\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Talk to [[Mosol Rei]] outside of [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]] in the south part of [[Karamja]].\n|difficulty = 3\n|description = New areas in the Southern part of Karamja Island have been discovered with a mysterious village.\nWho knows what hidden treasures exist, and what dangers lurk to guard them?\n|length = Long\n|requirements = Completion of [[Jungle Potion]]\n*20 {{Skill clickpic|Crafting}} [[Crafting]]\n*32 {{Skill clickpic|Agility}} [[Agility]] ([[boost]]able)\n*4 {{Skill clickpic|Smithing}} [[Smithing]] (if you want to make your own [[bronze wire]])\nMust be able to defend from many [[Undead one]]s (level 61-73) and able to defeat three monsters that are about level 90.\n|items = :''All required items (except for the bones and wire) can be bought at the [[general store]] in [[Tai Bwo Wannai]].\n\n*[[Spade]]\n*[[Lit torch]] or a [[candle]] ([[lantern]]s or [[black candle]]s don't work) (you will not get this item back)\n*[[Tinderbox]]\n*[[Rope]]\n*[[Bronze wire]] or [[bronze bar]] (wire is faster)\n*[[Hammer]]\n*[[Chisel]]\n*3 regular [[Bones]] (only ''normal'' bones work; a spare is a good idea in case you bury one)\n''\n'''Recommended:'''\n*Decent [[armour]] and a [[weapon]]\n*Good [[food]] (enough to make it through two long tunnels of level 73 monsters)\n*[[Stamina potion]]s\n*[[Antipoison potion]] ([[poison]] can hit up to 11 each time; a [[combat level]] of 65 or higher will make the '''very poisonous''' [[Tribesman|tribesmen]] non-aggressive)\n*[[Teleport]]s (for leaving dangerous areas in a hurry; [[ring of dueling]] is helpful for access to a glider; [[necklace of passage]], [[amulet of glory]] and several other viable options for easy access to [[fairy rings]]).\n*[[Papyrus]] and [[charcoal]] (only required if you lose an item during the quest)\n*Access to the [[Gnome glider]] and [[fairy rings]] makes travelling easier (don't forget your [[Dramen staff]])\n*[[Crumble Undead]] makes it easy to kill the 3 monsters.\n|kills = [[Nazastarool]] in 3 forms, levels 91, 68 and 93.

If you kill them, sometimes a cloud of [[poison gas]] will be released and hit you for damage.\n\nIn this cave system, you will need to find four items.\n*[[Stone-plaque]]: There is a strange-looking stone (4 on the map) on the other side of the pool, east of the smashed table. Use a [[chisel]] on the stone to obtain the Stone-plaque.\nClose to the strange-looking stone in which you got the stone-plaque from, you will see a smashed table (3 on the map). South-west of the table is a 'cave in' area (2 on the map). Search it to crawl through to the next cave.\n\n*[[Tattered scroll]]: Head north until you reach the end of the ruins. To the west, near the wall there will be some loose rocks (6 on the map). Search them. If you fail, you will get hit upwards of 4 points.\n*[[Crumpled scroll]]: Follow the cave around the bend, and head south-east until you come to a small dead-end branch. Search the sacks next to a smashed table (7 on the map).\n*[[Zadimus corpse]]: Head north to the far end of the cavern, where you find the old gallows (8 on the map). Search them and remove the corpse body. If you have all 4 items, from here you can simply teleport out.\n\n[[File:Ah Za Rhoon Map.png\u200e|center]]\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n:'''1''' - Entrance\n:'''2''' - Cave-in\n:'''3''' - Smashed table\n:'''4''' - Strange looking stone\n{{Col-2}}\n:'''5''' - Waterfall rocks\n:'''6''' - Loose rocks\n:'''7''' - Sacks\n:'''8''' - Gallows\n{{Col-end}}\n\n[[File:Shilo Village boat ride.png|thumb|250px|Taking the boat out of [[Ah Za Rhoon]].]]\nTo exit the dungeon, you can craft the smashed table into a raft and use it to leave. This does not always work; it is possible to get the message that there isn't enough wood left. In this case, you will have to leave by other means. If you want, you can continue south, then east to the end of the cave. Search the rocks you find there to leave via the waterfall. If you fall leaving this way, however, you can take a lot of damage. You will find yourself near the stepping stones to the east of [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]].\n\n===Scrolls from Ah Za Rhoon and the proper burial===\n[[File:Shilo Village - burying Zadimus corpse.png|thumb|250px|Zadimus' corpse is buried.]]\nRead both the scrolls and the plaque. Then, use both scrolls, the plaque, and the corpse on\u00a0[[Trufitus]]. Then, go to the tribal statue west of Trufitus' hut, and bury the [[Zadimus corpse]] to make the [[Spirit of Zadimus]] appear. He will give you a [[bone shard]]. Take the bone shard back to Trufitus, and he'll tell you to look for [[Tomb of Bervirius|Bervirius' tomb]].\n:'''Note:''' Be sure to read the scrolls and the plaque, or he won't tell you about Bervirius' tomb! Also, don't worry about the quest guide not updating too much. Once you've got all the items, you should be fine to go to Bervirius' tomb.\n\n===Tomb of Bervirius===\nYou now need to go to the [[Tomb of Bervirius]]. '''The fastest way to get here is fairy ring to {{fairycode|CKR}} then run South'''. From [[Tai Bwo Wannai]], go south towards [[Cairn Isle]], climb the rocks and cross the bridge to reach Cairn Isle (just below the [[Graahk]] [[hunting]] area). You can fall and take damage especially with low [[Agility]]. Note that running over the bridge with high Agility has a higher success rate.\n[[File:Tomb of Bervirius.png|thumb|250px|The Tomb of Bervirius.]]\nOnce you're at the other side, search the well-stacked rocks on the north side of the island, and enter the crawl-way (32 Agility needed). You may become stuck many times, but keep trying. Head south to the dolmen, and search it to get a [[sword pommel]], a [[locating crystal]] (you take 10 damage if you drop it) and [[Bervirius notes]]\u00a0(if you lose these items, you will need [[charcoal]] and [[papyrus]] to get to\u00a0Bervirius\u00a0notes again). Exit the cave by climbing the rock slide (2). '''(At this point you can teleport out, as you sometimes fall and take damage trying to climb out. It is advisable to teleport to a fairy ring and go to D K P for the next section)'''\n[[File:Tomb of Bervirius map.png|centre]]\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n:'''1''' - Entrance\n{{Col-2}}\n:'''2''' - Rock slide\n{{Col-2}}\n:'''3''' - Dolmen\n{{Col-end}}\nRead the scrolls. You now need to make a new necklace. Use a [[chisel]] on the sword pommel to make [[bone beads]]. If you don't already have [[bronze wire]], use your [[bronze bar]] on an anvil (there is one north-west of [[Trufitus]]), and choose to make bronze wire. Use this on the beads to make the [[beads of the dead]] necklace. You're now ready to take on the final boss.\n:'''Note: DO NOT''' drop the sword pommel or the bone beads (made from the sword pommel) by accident. It will turn to dust, and you will have to go get it again.\n\n===Tomb of Rashiliyia===\n[[File:Shilo Village tomb entrance.png|thumb|The hidden doors to the Tomb of Rashiliyia.]]\n'''''Items needed:''' [[Chisel]], [[bone shard]], [[beads of the dead]] necklace, [[locating crystal]], [[food]], [[weapon]], [[armour]], 3 regular [[bones]] OR kill undead to get bones in the dungeon. It is advisable to bring bones and have an emergency [[teleport]] if your character is low level. You can kill [[chicken]]s in [[Tai Bwo Wannai Village]] to get regular bones if you need some.''\n\n:'''Tip:''' If you have access to the [[fairy ring]] network, you can use the karambwan [[fishing spot]] fairy ring to travel just north of the [[Rashiliyia's Tomb|Tomb of Rashiliyia]] entrance ({{Fairycode|DKP}}).\n\nNow head East to the river and cross the log near the crashed glider. [[Rashiliyia's Tomb]] is north of the crashed [[gnome glider]], a bit south from the coast. You might run into [[The Shaikahan]] (level 83), who you cannot damage with regular weapons. East of the Shaikahan, look for a searchable palm tree. It should be noted that the entrance is hidden behind a hill and is most visible if you are facing south. Search the palm trees to find two doors. Search these doors to find the shape of the keyhole, and then use your [[chisel]] on the [[bone shard]] to make a [[bone key (Shilo Village)|bone key]], put on the [[beads of the dead]] necklace, and use the key on the door to enter.\n\n[[File:Rashiliyia's Tomb map.png\u200e|center]]\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n:'''1''' - Entrance\n:'''2''' - Rock slope\n{{Col-2}}\n:'''3''' - Skeleton door\n:'''4''' - Dolmen\n{{Col-end}}\nYou'll find [[undead one]]s all throughout the dungeon in a [[multicombat area]] - more will be summoned if you pick up the coins, which turn to dust. They are inaccurate, but can hit hard (9).\n\n===Nazastarool===\nRunning past the [[undead]], go through the ancient gates (while wearing the ''[[beads of the dead]] necklace'') and down the rock slope (hard to get back up), head west, then south, then south-west until you find some doors. '''Note: Other sets of dummy doors exist if you take a wrong turn.''' Use three regular [[bones]] on these doors. If for any reason you leave the room, the three bones will not be necessary to enter it again. Enter and keep the [[Beads of the dead|beads]] on and search the dolmen.\n[[File:Nazastarool safe spot.png|thumb|220px|Lure Nazastarool to the northern part of the dolmen to safespot him.]]\nYou will be attacked by [[Nazastarool]], a level 91 [[zombie]]. He uses [[Melee]] throughout the battle. You can [[safespot]] all three forms from any side of the dolmen. After you defeat him, he will turn into a level 68 [[skeleton]]. After you defeat him, he'll turn into a level 93 [[ghost]]. Once you have defeated the ghost, you will get the [[Rashiliyia corpse|corpse of Rashiliyia]]. If you die when you are fighting, you will have to fight only those you did not defeat again, not all three forms!\n:'''Tip:''' Between forms, a dialogue comes in the conversation window. In extremis, perform some other action, like burying the spare bones you brought, or inspecting your quest log, and the next incarnation will not immediately appear, giving you time to heal, leave, etc.\n:'''Note:''' A bug sometimes allows you to summon a second ghost while fighting the first, which is not a good idea. You get two corpses but only one in your inventory.\nTo leave, simply return to where you entered\u2014remember to use your key on the door to exit. It may be recommended for lower level players to instead teleport out. If you attack an undead one while holding Rashiliya's corpse, her spirit will appear, and a message displays in the chat box: \"You feel invisible hands starting to choke you...\" You will then be briefly [[Stun (status)|stunned]] and unable to act, while Rashiliya spawns several more undead ones to fight you, in a similar manner as what happens upon trying to pick up the coins. Finally, if you attempt to open the doors to exit the cave without using your key on the door, your character will say:\n:''\"Oh no, I'm going to be stuck in here forever!''\n:''How will I ever get out!''\n:''I'm too young to die!\"''\n\n===Rashiliyia's corpse===\nNow, you need to find a proper burial place for [[Rashiliyia corpse|Rashiliyia's remains]]. The clue to this location can be found in the [[tattered scroll]] that was found in [[Ah Za Rhoon]]: \"a tomb that is surrounded by and level with the sea. The only remedy for containing the spirits of witches and the undead.\"\n[[File:Shilo Village - Rashiliyia laid to rest.png|thumb|250px|Rashiliyia is finally laid to rest.]]\nGo back to the [[Tomb of Bervirius]] on [[Cairn Isle]] west from [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]], and use the corpse on the dolmen. [[Rashiliyia]] herself will appear before you, thanking you for letting her rest in peace and will give you your reward.\n\n:'''Tip:''' If you have access to the [[fairy ring]] network, you can simply use the fairy ring code northwest of the exit of the [[Rashiliyia's Tomb|Tomb of Rashiliyia]], and teleport from there to Cairn Isle ({{Fairycode|CKR}}).  To walk out of Shilo village, go through both front gates and climb over the cart.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Shilo Village\n|image = [[File:Shilo Village reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*3,875 {{Skill clickpic|Crafting}} Crafting [[experience]]\n*Access to [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]]\n*Ability to quick travel to Shilo Village using the [[Shilo Village cart system|cart]] near the [[Brimhaven]] docks\n}}\nAfter completing the quest, every item you got during the quest can be sold to [[Yanni Salika]] in Shilo Village for 2,000 [[coins]] total.\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Shilo Village is required for the following:\n*[[Recipe for Disaster]]\n*[[Legends' Quest]]\n*[[Lunar Diplomacy]]\n*[[One Small Favour]]\n\n{{Shilo Village}}"], "Spirits of the Elid": ["{{External|rs}}\n{{Has quick guide}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Spirits of the Elid\n|image = [[File:Spirits of the Elid.png|300px]]\n|number = 94\n|members = Yes\n|release = 5 December [[2005]]\n|update = Nardah, Tool Sheds & Spirits of the Elid\n|series = [[List of quest series#Desert series|Desert]]\n|difficulty = Intermediate\n|developer = Paul G\n}}\n'''Spirits of the Elid''' is a quest in which you must assist the villagers of [[Nardah]] in restoring water to their town, which has all but disappeared.

He will tell you that there is a curse on the town, and there is no more water available to the people anymore. \n\nGo to the house just north of the mayor's house and speak to [[Ghaslor the Elder]]. He will give you a [[ballad]]. '''Do not bank/drop the ballad as it is needed to complete the quest.'''\n\nAfter doing so, go west and speak to [[Shiratti the Custodian]]. After speaking to Shiratti, search the cupboards west in the building and use your [[needle]] and thread on the [[torn robe]]s. You will turn them into [[Robe of elidinis|Robes of Elidinis]]. '''Make sure to search the cupboards twice to get both robes!''' Steal the [[ancestral key]] from the enclosed area using [[Telekinetic Grab]].\n\n[[File:Spirits of the Elid - Waterfall.png|thumb|200px|The waterfall.]]\nThe next location is the waterfall at the source of the [[River Elid]]. To get there, either:\n*Leave Nardah and walk north-west until you come to the banks of the River Elid, and then follow them to the north until you come to a waterfall at the source of the river. On the way, you'll pass respawn points for a [[bronze pickaxe]], a [[shortbow]], and some [[bronze arrows]]. Take these if you don't already have them in your inventory.\n*Alternatively, return to [[Shantay Pass]] (via [[magic carpet]]s or [[Amulet of glory]]/[[Ring of dueling]] teleport to [[Al-Kharid]]) and retrieve a bow and some arrows from the bank if you don't have in your inventory. You also will pass an arrow spawn on your way through the desert. Once back in the desert, head south-east to a bridge and cross the River Elid\u2014then, follow the river north to the [[Water Ravine Dungeon|dungeon]] entrance.\n*Alternatively, you can use a [[Necklace of passage]] to teleport to Eagle's Eyrie and run southwest for a short while. The [[Necklace of passage]] is an enchanted [[Jade Necklace]].\n\nWhen you reach the dungeon entrance, use your [[rope]] on the root above the waterfall to enter.\n\n'''While wearing the Robes of Elidinis''', open the great stone door with the ancestral key in your inventory. If you are not wearing the robes your character will ask what he could possibly have forgotten.\n\nOnce you're inside, ignore the door to the north; head east a short ways to where you'll see three doors. Upon attempting to open each door, you'll be attacked by one of three coloured level-75 golems, which can only be defeated by one type of attack style ([[Crush]]/[[Slash]]/[[Stab]]). If you forgot a crush or stab weapon, your pickaxe (if decent material) can replace it. After defeating them, the door they protected will open. Enter the room and solve the puzzle to clear the water channel:\n\n'''NOTE:''' If you attempt to open the door before the golem has finished its death animation, another golem will spawn.\n[[File:Spirits of the Elid - Clearing the Channel.png|thumb|200px|Clearing the channel using range.]]\n*The [[black golem]] protecting the '''north-east room''' is damaged by '''crushing attacks'''. Once inside, you'll see a [[target]] on the other side of the water channel. Equip your bow and arrow and shoot it. Once you've hit it, the channel will be cleared. If you don't do damage and the water doesn't start flowing, you didn't clear it.\n\n*The [[grey golem]] protecting the '''east room''' is damaged by '''slashing attacks'''. Once it's dead, clear the water channel with your pickaxe.\n*The [[white golem]] in the '''south room''' is damaged by '''stabbing attacks'''. Kill it, then clear the water channel behind the door with [[Thieving]].\n\nAfter you clear all three channels, go north through the remaining door, walk around the lake, and talk to the spirits, [[Nirrie]], [[Tirrie]] and [[Hallak]]. They'll tell you to recover the sacred [[statuette (Spirit of the Elid)|Statue of Elidinis]] and return it to the shrine in Nardah to break the curse.\n\nGo to Nardah and talk to the mayor again. He will tell you that they threw the statue down a crevice west of town. While you're here, take the mayor's [[shoes]] from beside the door and use your [[knife]] on them to remove their [[sole]]s. (The mayor won't let you if you're too close to him.)\n[[File:Spirits of the Elid - Crevice location.png|thumb|left|150px|The crevice, west of Nardah.]]\nGo west from the general store in Nardah until you come to the crevice and use a rope on it. You need a [[light source]], or else, you'll be eaten alive by tiny bugs. Talk to the [[Genie (Spirits of the Elid)|genie]] (the evil brother of the [[Genie|random event]]). He will tell you to get the mayor's sole in exchange for the statue. Give the soles to him to get the statue back.\n\nFinally, take the statue to the shrine back in town (the building you stole the key in) and place it on the stand.\n\n'''Congratulations!

He will give you a [[small fishing net]] with which to catch fresh monkfish. The [[fishing spot]] for them is located to the north-west. If you are using a boost from level 57 ([[Admiral pie]]s), then you will need at least four pies because when a [[Sea troll|troll]] spawns, you cannot continue fishing, and therefore, your level may drop.\n\nWhile fishing, you will be attacked by three Sea Trolls whose levels get progressively higher - levels 65, 87 and 101. You must kill these in order to continue fishing. When you have caught the fresh monkfish, you can cook it on a [[range]] to the south. You may burn the fish. When you have five cooked fresh monkfish, take them to Arnold.\n\n====Franklin Caranos====\n[[Franklin Caranos]] is near the entrance gate of the [[Piscatoris Fishing Colony|Colony]]. He will ask you to make five [[iron sheet]]s to repair the west walls. He will give you a [[tinderbox]] to heat the metal press. If you have the [[iron bar]]s and [[logs]], you can skip the following steps:\n[[File:Fixing colony wall.png|thumb|220px|A player fixing the colony walls.]]\nPick up a [[pickaxe]] and an [[axe]] from the pile east of Franklin. Exit the Colony via the gate, and head back underneath the hole. To the south, you should find several rocks; mine enough [[iron ore]]s to make five iron bars (you will be able to smith them with the usual 50% success rate at the Colony), and cut down a [[dead tree]] for some logs. Return to the Colony and smith your ores into bars, returning to the rocks and mining more ores if required, until you have five bars.\n\nGo into the building with the [[furnace]], and use your logs with the firebox and light them. Then, use your iron bars with the press to make iron sheets. Tell Franklin that you have the sheets, and he will give you a [[hammer]], with which you can repair the walls to the west. Once you have done this, talk to Franklin again.\n:'''<font color=\"red\">Important:</font>''' Keep the pickaxe since you'll need it to mine [[clay]] in the next part if you didn't bring any.\n\n===Raising an army===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[pickaxe]] (to mine the [[clay]], needed only if you didn't bring any).''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' 7 [[bones]], a [[pot]] and a [[pot lid]]. (If making a pot lid, bring a pickaxe.)''\n\nNext, go back to the [[Wise Old Man]] and [[Herman Caranos]], who tell you that they need an army to fight and defeat the [[Sea troll]]s once and for all. The Wise Old Man tells you to visit [[Wizard Frumscone]], in the basement of the [[Wizards' Guild]].\n:'''Note:''' This is where you need to boost your [[Magic]] level if it is lower than 66.\n\nYou may find it advisable to pick up a [[pickaxe]], if you have not done so already, before you leave for [[Yanille]]. You can use any recommended methods as mentioned to travel to Yanille.\n\nAt Yanille, you may get seven normal [[bones]], [[pot]] and [[pot lid]] from the bank if you have them. Head into the Wizard's Guild and go down the ladder. Wizard Frumscone will appear and refuse to help you, but he does tell you of one who may - [[Malignius Mortifer]].\n:'''<font color=\"red\">Important:</font>''' Be sure to bank any [[god]]-related items prior to talking to Malignius, or he will refuse to help you ([[Bandos chestplate]]/[[Bandos tassets|tassets]], Guthix-armour or the [[ancient mace]] are fine).\n\nAfter making the [[pottery]], however, you may wear your items.\n[[File:Malignius Mortifer location.png|frame|220px|Malignius Mortifer's location.]]\nYou can use your charged [[amulet of glory]] if you have them to teleport to [[Draynor Village]], and head west to find Malignius, who is accompanied by elemental wizards, slightly north-west of the [[Port Sarim]] [[Betty's Magic Emporium|magic shop]].\n\nAlternatively, you can use the southern portal at the top of the Guild to take you to the [[Dark Wizards' Tower]]. The [[dark wizard]]s drop [[bones]], so you can kill seven of them for seven bones if you still need them. Walk south, through the gate, and then south-east from here to find Malignius.\n\nMalignius will tell you that he needs seven normal bones. You can kill [[Highwayman|highwaymen]] or the [[chicken]]s in the farm nearby for these. (You cannot kill the surrounding wizards, as they drop [[ashes]].) When you give them to him, he will tell you that you also need some way of storing the seeds he will give you, and that you should ask in the [[Crafting Guild]] to the west. He will give you a [[brown apron]], which will allow you access.\n\nAsk the [[Master Crafter|master craftsmen]] (the one with dreadlocks and no skillcape) about how to store the seeds until you find the one that will tell you; you will need simply a pot with a pot lid. ''You may skip the rest of this paragraph if you have both items''. Mine two pieces of [[clay]] in the [[Crafting Guild mining site|Guild mine]]; use the [[jug]] in the northern end of the Guild filled with water from the sink to the south to soften the clay, and then shape them on the [[potter's wheel]]. Fire them in the [[pottery oven]].\n:'''Warning:''' Now, you may wish to restock your combat supplies for the upcoming fight at a bank as Malignius will, without any warning, teleport you to the [[Piscatoris Fishing Colony]] after you have finished talking with him.\n\nNow, return to Malignius with your pot and pot lid, and he will teleport you to the Fishing Colony.\n\n===The final battle===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Combat equipment]] to defeat a level 170 [[Sea Troll Queen]], which is able to use [[Magic]], [[Melee]] and can drain [[Prayer]]. [[Ranged]]/Magic [[safespot]]s are available but not advisable.''\n:'''<font color=\"red\">Warning:</font>''' Dying to the Sea Troll Queen will make you lose all items dropped upon death.\n\nAfter entering the [[Piscatoris Fishing Colony|Colony]] and talking to [[Herman Caranos]], you will be shown a cutscene of your army of [[Skeleton Mage]]s defeating the [[Sea troll]]s and then the [[Wise Old Man]] killing the levelless [[Sea Troll General]]. However, while he is celebrating, he gets hit for 254 damage (which doesn't make the slightest dent on his health bar). He will be disabled for the rest of the fight, so you must take on the [[Sea Troll Queen]] yourself.\n\n<div align=\"center\"><gallery captionalign=\"left\" columns=\"3\">\nRise from the Sea.png|The Sea Trolls rise from the ocean depths.\nSwan Song army.png|This means war!\nSea Troll General dies.png|The Wise Old Man kills the [[Sea Troll General]]\nWise Old Man weakened.png|The Wise Old Man is badly hurt by a powerful water spell.\nThe Sea Troll Queen.png|You must fight the Sea Troll Queen!\n</gallery></div>\n\nThe Queen cannot move from her location, so anywhere not directly next to her is suitable for long-ranged attacks. The Queen uses the [[Magic]] attack [[Water Wave]] and a basic [[Melee]] attack where possible. If you are using overhead [[protection prayers]] and are not within melee range, the queen will use a [[Prayer]]-draining attack. This means that ''long-ranged attacks are inadvisable'' unless you are confident in your [[armour]] to protect you from powerful magical spells (e.g. [[Armadyl armour]]). Meleeing the queen means she will not use her prayer draining attack; however, she uses both Melee and Magic attacks. She is much more damaging with magical attacks, so it is '''best to use [[Protect from Magic]] and wear [[Armour/Melee armour|melee armour]]'''. She is not too hard for a skilled fighter, though she should not be taken for a pushover either.\n\nAfter defeating the queen, talk to [[Herman]] to finish the quest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Swan Song\n|image = [[File:Swan Song reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = *{{Skill clickpic|Magic|15,000}} [[Magic]] [[experience]]\n*{{Skill clickpic|Prayer|10,000}} [[Prayer]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Fishing|10,000}} [[Fishing]] experience\n*25,000 [[coins]]\n*Access to the [[Piscatoris Fishing Colony]]\n**The ability to fish [[monkfish]]\n**The ability to use [[Skeleton Mage]]s for training\n*Access to the following items from [[Malignius Mortifer]] upon request:\n**A [[brown apron]]\n**[[Bone seeds]] (requires an [[airtight pot]])\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\n*[[Making Friends with My Arm]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*{{Wp|Swan song}} is an idiom referring to a final theatrical or dramatic appearance, or any final work or accomplishment.\n*{{Wp|Lophius|Monkfish}} is the common name of a number of different species of fish.\n*The [[Sea Troll Queen]] looks nothing like a [[Sea troll]] at all, but more like a giant squid or octopus.\n*Near the end of the quest, you end up begging for the [[Wise Old Man]]'s [[blue partyhat]]; the second most valuable item back in the day, yet you are ignored completely.\n*The species of [[monkfish]], which will be available for players to fish after this quest, receives its image from a deep sea monkfish known as {{Wp|Lophius piscatorius|anglerfish}}, whose Latin name is ''Lophius piscatorius''.

Then, go to the banana plantation and pick a banana, if you don't have one already. Use your knife on it to obtain a sliced banana. The rum, combined with a [[sliced banana]], will be necessary in a later part of the quest. (However, make sure you combine it now ''before'' teleporting, or the Karamjan rum will break)\n\nAfter obtaining the Karamjan rum, travel south to Tai Bwo Wannai and talk with Timfraku upstairs in the north-west house with a quest [[icon]] above it. Talk with him until he asks you to gather his sons, [[Tamayu]], [[Tiadeche]], and [[Tinsay]], in the village.\n:In order to avoid accidentally banking/losing the [[Karamjan rum (sliced banana)]], visit Tinsay at [[Cairn Isle]] and give it to him. (This will fulfil the first of three requests he makes later on)\n[[File:TBW Trio Map.png|thumb|centre|400px|A map of southern [[Karamja]].]]\n\n===Tamayu===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[steel spear]] or better, a [[small fishing net]], a [[pestle and mortar]] or 6 gold, and one 4-dose or two 3-dose [[agility potion]]s.''\n\n'''''Optional:''' [[Logs]], a [[tinderbox]], and a [[raw karambwan]] (one is obtainable later in the quest)''\n\nYou can find Tamayu southeast of the village at the mine. He will return to Tai Bwo Wannai only once he has killed [[the Shaikahan]]. Talk to him; ask him when he will succeed and offer to join him on his next hunt. During a [[cutscene]] Tamayu will fail to defeat the Shaikahan. He will claim that he is overpowered by its strength, regenerating health, and agility.\n\nDo not give your [[spear]] or [[agility potion]] to Tamayu yet. Go to the pond southwest of Tamayu and net-fish for [[karambwanji]]. You must poison the spear with karambwan before giving it to Tamayu. \n\nFish for at least 22 [[raw karambwanji]]. These are stackable in 1 inventory slot.  (It's recommended to have a few spares or keep the net for later if your [[Cooking]] level is low.)\n\nNow travel north. If you don't have a pestle and mortar, you can buy one at [[Jiminua's Jungle Store]] (general store icon) north-west of the village. Then continue and and talk to [[Lubufu]] (near the POH portal) by the fishing [[icon]] on the southern shore of [[Brimhaven]]. Select to \"Talk about him...\" and ask him how old he is. Then offer to help him collect bait, and then say that he sounds like he could do with the help. He will then tell you to catch 20 karambwanji (stackable). If you banked earlier, hand over the necessary amount or else you may need to return to the pond. Next, ask him what he uses to catch karambwan, followed by what he does with them, and he will ask you if you want to become his apprentice. He will then give you a [[karambwan vessel]] and the information that it must be filled with karambwanji as bait. You will need three vessels total so use the drop trick to obtain two more from him. Use a karambwanji on one of these vessels. [[File:Tai Bwo Wannai Trio Tiadeche.png|thumb|250px|Tiadeche catches a karambwan.]]\n\n===Tiadeche===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[karambwan vessel]], and a [[raw karambwanji]]. Logs and Tinderbox''\n\nNext, go to the northeast corner of the jungle (fairy ring {{Fairycode|DKP}}). Tiadeche can be found close to the ring, near the coast. Find Tiadeche, and talk to him. He says he will go back to Tai Bwo Wannai after you teach him how to catch karambwan. Give him your full [[karambwan vessel]] and he will subsequently give you a [[raw karambwan]]. He will also ask you to visit his brother Tinsay for another matter. Grab the seaweed that spawns here on the beach as you will need it later on.\n\nOnce you have the raw karambwan, cook it to obtain a [[poison karambwan]]. If Ironmen are not successful in their attempt, they will need 65 [[Fishing]] to catch another. Use the [[pestle and mortar]] on the karambwan to produce [[karambwan paste]]. Then, use the paste on the [[spear]] to create a karambwan poisoned spear. If you eat the karambwan you will be [[poison]]ed and can easily die, so right-click on it and select the \"use\" option, or simply use the pestle and mortar on it to prevent eating it.\n\nNow, head back to Tamayu by running south, crossing the agility shortcut, then running west to the mine. If you didn't purchase the [[Jogre bones]], kill a [[Jogre]] on the way and pick up the bones. \n[[File:Tai Bwo Wannai Trio Shaikahan.png|thumb|250px|Tamayu fights the Shaikahan.]]\nOnce you have returned to Tamayu, hand him the newly poisoned spear and [[agility potion]] and ask to join him on his next hunt. He will now be successful and promise to return to the village once you've talked with his brothers and father.\n\nTo save some time helping Tinsay, kill a nearby [[monkey]] (with [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]) and use its [[Monkey corpse|corpse]] on Tamayu. He will ask you if you'd like to skin it, returning the [[monkey bones]] and [[Monkey skin|skin]]. This can only be done after you have helped him defeat the Shaikahan (you only need to save the skin).\n\n===Tinsay===\nTalk to Tinsay on [[Cairn Isle]], southwest from Tamayu. He is located up the rockslide and across the bridge. He'll tell you that he's trying to repair the tribal statue in the village. He has lost his sanity recently due to some sort of accident with a jogre. He asks for three special local items.\n\n====Banana rum (if not done beforehand)====\n'''''Items required:''' A [[banana]], [[Karamjan rum]], and a [[knife]].''\n\nDo not use a whole banana on the rum without slicing it. It will create a [[Karamjan rum (banana)|joke item]], a banana stuffed into the top of the bottle. After you add the banana slices to the Karamjan rum it will not break while teleporting.\n\nThe first thing he'll ask you to get him is a bottle of banana-flavoured rum. Head to [[Musa Point]], and buy a bottle of [[Karamjan rum]] from the liquor store there. Then, go into the [[general store]], take the banana and knife off the table and use the knife with the banana to slice it. Add these [[Sliced banana|slices]] to the rum and give it to Tinsay (be careful not to eat the slices!).\n\n====Seaweed sandwich====\n'''''Items required:''' [[Seaweed]], a [[monkey corpse]], and a [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] method to kill a monkey.''\n\nLike before, do not use a [[monkey corpse]] on the [[seaweed]] before taking the monkey to Tamayu for skinning. This will create another [[Stuffed monkey|joke item]], and you will need to obtain another monkey corpse and more seaweed.\n\nNext he wants you to bring him a [[seaweed sandwich]] made with [[monkey skin]]. If you forgot seaweed get some from the shore south of [[Cairn Isle]]. Use the monkey skin you got earlier with the seaweed to make a sandwich. Give it to Tinsay.\n\n====Marinated jogre bones====\n'''''Items required:''' [[Jogre bones]], a [[raw karambwanji]], a [[pestle and mortar]], [[logs]], and a [[tinderbox]].''\n\nYou now need to get some burnt jogre bones marinated in karambwanji sauce. Be careful not to bury the bones! Use the bones on a [[tinderbox]] to burn them. If your [[Firemaking]] level is below 30 you will not be able to burn the jogre bones with a tinderbox. Instead, you will have to burn them in the nearest [[furnace]]. (or [[Superheat Item]] works)\n\nNext, catch another [[raw karambwanji]], and grind it with your [[pestle and mortar]]. Then, add the [[Karambwanji paste|paste]] to the [[Burnt jogre bones|burnt bones]] to get [[pasty jogre bones]]. Don't left click. Cook the pasty jogre bones on a [[range]] or [[fire]] to marinate them. Give these to Tinsay.\n\nNow that you've helped Tinsay, he will regain his sanity and agree to return to Tai Bwo Wannai. \n\nBefore you leave, use one of the [[karambwan vessel]]s on him to receive the [[Crafting manual]] for Tiadeche. Return the [[Crafting manual]] to Tiadeche and they will both return to Tai Bwo Wannai.\n\n===Wrapping up===\nAfter you're done with all three brothers, talk to the Timfraku again for your reward. Then, talk to each of the three brothers in their local shops for an additional reward!\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Tai Bwo Wannai Trio\n|image = [[File:Tai Bwo Wannai Trio reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*{{Skill clickpic|Cooking|5,000}} [[Cooking]] [[experience]]\n*{{Skill clickpic|Fishing|5,000}} [[Fishing]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Attack|2,500}} [[Attack]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Strength|2,500}} [[Strength]] experience\n**All experience point rewards are gained from talking to the brothers after the quest rather than immediately.\n*2,000 [[Coins]]\n*A karambwan-poisoned [[rune spear]] from talking to Tamayu in the village after the quest.

Ask him if he needs any help, and he will tell you that his ancestor, Magnus Rimor, lead an expedition to [[Mount Quidamortem]] in the [[Kebos region]] over a thousand years ago, and never returned, with the records declaring he perished along with the party.\n[[File:Tale of the Righteous - talking to Phileas.png|thumb|270px|A player talks to Phileas in his home.]]\nHowever, a few days ago, he received a parcel from an unknown individual containing an old journal written by King Shayzien VII, with a note on the parcel claiming the journal was stolen from the [[Tower of Magic]] during the uprising against [[Xeric]] in the 47th decade. Although most of the journal is illegible, he managed to find an extract stating \"''Quidamortem's creatures are compatible. The experimentation is proving successful and we will soon be ready to mass produce.''\"\n\nThe extract had a date in the 37th decade, and yet the expedition was declared a failure a decade before, leading Phileas to question why the king wrote about Quidamortem a decade after the failure of the expedition. He will ask you to discover the truth about his ancestor's expedition; agree to help him. He will ask you to try and learn more about the expedition by visiting the [[Library Historical Archive]].\n\n===Perhaps the archives are incomplete===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[melee]] weapon, a [[ranged]] weapon with ammunition, and runes to cast any [[magic]] [[combat spell]]. '''Note:''' Bring enough [[runes]] for more than one cast - it's possible to \"flub\" the attack spell.''\n\nHead to the [[Arceuus House Library]], and teleport to the Archive via [[Archeio]]. Speak to [[Pagida]], who has been investigating King Shayzien VII's additions to the [[Tower of Magic]].\n\nSpeak to [[Pagida]], and he will tell you that King Shayzien VII spent more time in the Tower of Magic than any other king, and oversaw construction of various new sections, including a prison, which was built around the same time as the expedition, but has been abandoned for many years. You will ask if you can access the prison, and he will agree to do so.\n[[File:Tale of the Righteous - cleansing crystals.png|thumb|270px|Cleansing the crystals in the Tower of Magic's prison.]]\nThe prison contains a strange device in the centre that can be pushed towards the north, east, south and west. The objective is to have all the crystals cleansed in order to open the north prison door:\n*Push the device as far west as you can, then stand on the north side of the device and attack the device using magic.\n*Then, standing on the south side of the device, attack it using melee.\n*Push the device all the way east, and attack the device using ranged from its south side.\n'''NOTE: You must bring all 3 attack styles with you at the same time. If you have to leave this area only partially completing it, you will have to redo this segment again.'''\n\nOnce all the crystals have been cleansed, the prison doors to the north will open. Investigate the skeleton inside, and you will discover some writing on the floor stating \"''Lizards on the mountain. Do not trust the King. The altar is a lie.\"''\n\n===Another expedition===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[pickaxe]] and [[rope]]. [[Equipment]] and [[food]] to defeat a level 46 enemy.''\n\nReturn to [[Phileas]], and tell him of your discovery. He will ask that you attempt the same expedition in order to find out what the original team discovered, and asks you to speak to [[Lord Shiro Shayzien]] in the war tent just west of [[Xeric's Look out]].\n\n[[File:Path to Raids.png|thumb|280px|Getting to Mount Quidamortem from the Shayziens' Wall.]]\nSpeak to Lord Shayzien upstairs in the war tent, and ask if you can go on an expedition to Mount Quidamortem. He will agree on the condition that any discoveries made are to be brought to him first, as King Shayzien VII was his ancestor and he wants to be made aware of any discoveries that may present him in a bad light.\n\nHead to the top of [[Mount Quidamortem]]. You may wish to bring food and some type of [[antipoison]] as you will run past various aggressive, poisonous [[lizardmen]] on the trip to the mountain. After you arrive at the peak, speak to [[Historian Duffy]] (whilst you are here, speak to the [[mountain guide]] as you then unlock the ability to quick travel to and from the [[Shayziens' Wall]]). You will tell him of the floor writing you found in the prison, leading him to believe that the lizardmen were not of unnatural origin and have existed before [[Xeric]] did.\nHe will tell you that a crevice to the west of the mountain was recently uncovered, and that it may lead to what you are searching for. Make your way to the west of the mountain, and use your rope on the crevice. Enter the crevice to find yourself in a [[Quidamortem Cave|red cave]]. Mine the first boulder with a pickaxe, and push the second boulder.\n[[File:Tale of the Righteous - fighting Corrupt Lizardman.png|thumb|left|220px|Fighting the corrupt lizardman.]]\n[[File:Tale of the Righteous - inspecting Unstable Altar.png|thumb|230px|A player inspects the unstable altar, and hears a mysterious voice.]]\nUpon walking close to the magic gate, a [[Corrupt Lizardman]] will appear and attack you. '''The corrupt lizardman will deal poison like the other lizardmen, so an antipoison will be useful.''' Defeat it, and inspect the unstable altar past the gate. You will hear a [[Mysterious Voice]] exclaiming \"''Rickard! Turn away! Don't do this!''\", but will unable to make sense of it.\n\nReturn to Duffy and tell him of your discoveries in the [[Quidamortem Cave|cave]]. The museum expedition will then travel into the cave; follow them. Once inside the cave, speak to Duffy. He will tell you the cave predates Xeric, and wonders if it was King Shayzien VII who created the lizardmen. He will add that some believe the two are one and the same. He will then tell you to speak to [[Gnosi]].\n[[File:Tale of the Righteous - cave temple.png|thumb|left|220px|The temple housing an unstable altar.]]\nSpeak to Gnosi who is nearby. She will tell you the reason Xeric ruled Great Kourend unopposed was because of the power of the [[Dark Altar]], and that he came to Mount Quidamortem to construct the [[Chambers of Xeric]] after his exile. Gnosi believes the reason Xeric survived in Quidamortem is the unstable altar nearby, which appears to give off the same power as the Dark Altar. She further states that it was created to amplify the Dark Altar's power, allowing it to reach areas it previously could not. As it is still giving out power, Gnosi wonders if Xeric had used it to extend his lifespan. She will then tell you to report these findings to the [[Arceuus House Library|Library]], but you tell her that Lord Shayzien asked you to report to him first should any discoveries be made.\n\n===Finishing up===\n[[File:Tale of the Righteous - Phileas house trashed.png|thumb|240px|Phileas' house has been trashed, and he has mysteriously disappeared!]]\nReturn to [[Lord Shayzien]] (talk to the mountain guide to make the journey faster if you don't have a teleport) and inform him of your discovery. He will ask for proof, and asks you to visit [[Phileas]] for the journal. Return to Phileas, only to find that his tent has been trashed and he himself has gone missing.\n\nReturn to Lord Shayzien once more, and he will open an investigation into Phileas' disappearance. Without the parcel, no concrete evidence can be linked to King Shayzien VII and your discoveries, but he will contact the research team and ensure their discoveries are documented.\n\n'''Congratulations!

If not, use Option A. Partial completion is possible, you must only reach the point at which it is possible to obtain the [[Brooch (The Lost Tribe)|Brooch]].'''\n\n====Option A====\nTo start, you need to find [[Juna]] deep inside the caves under the [[Lumbridge Swamp]]. A [[bullseye lantern]] is recommended to get deep enough safely, as a bullseye lantern will not be extinguished, will not explode from swamp gas, and cannot break. You don't have to make it yourself, as a player with high enough [[Smithing]] and [[Crafting]] can put one together for you, but you must be able to [[Firemaking|light]] it yourself. Before you enter the caves, use a cut [[sapphire]] on the bullseye lantern to get a [[sapphire lantern]]. If you do not do this now, you will not be able to swap in the caves, as an update does not allow you to extinguish your lantern. This sapphire lantern will also light the caves. If you go to Juna's cave through the normal route, as you pass by [[Wall beast|holes in the wall]], stop one square away from them; then, run past them. You will not be grabbed by the wall beasts if you use this method.\n\nYou can enter the cave from the swamp, travelling south, then hugging the south wall all the way until there's a place where you can jump on a rock to cross a small, subterranean river. On the way, you will pass by a room where swamp gas will blow up any open flames you are carrying on you if you take too long to go past, each one hitting 10-15 damage. Watch for a grey 'X' marked on the northern side of a wall, this is the room. South of the [[Giant frog|frogs]] is a cave entrance. From there, head east, climb down the slope, and continue east until you see Juna sitting in front of the cave. Talk to her to begin the quest.\n\nSkip to the the '''Juna''' paragraph to continue.\n\n====Option B====\nAs mentioned above, it's a good idea to have a lit [[Sapphire lantern|sapphire bullseye lantern]] made. Since you have at least started [[The Lost Tribe]] quest, you won't need the spiny helmet, you can just go to the basement of [[Lumbridge Castle]], climb through the hole in the wall, head south, and then climb through the hole to get into the cave (right-click use on your pickaxe on the second hole to clear the pathway). From there, head straight south to the [[Giant frog|frogs]] and then jump across the stepping stone at the southern river, and enter another the tunnel at south. From there, head east, climb down the slope, and continue east until you see [[Juna]] sitting in front of the cave. Talk to her to begin the quest.\n\n===Juna===\nWhen you talk to [[Juna]], she will tell you some stories about the Tears and tell you of how very bored she has become. She's willing to let you into the cave for a little while to gather some of the miraculous Tears of Guthix, but first, she has a task for you. To collect the tears, you will need a [[stone bowl]]. Getting there will be a bit tricky, though, since you can't quite climb up to where the rocks you need are.\n\n===The Light Creatures===\n[[File:Lightcreatureridin.png|thumb]]\nYou cannot climb up the rocks to the south, so instead, head north of [[Juna]] up the path, and climb the rocks. In the big black middle area are a group of floating orbs of light called [[light creature]]s.\n\nUse your lit\u00a0[[sapphire lantern]]\u00a0on one of the blue floating creatures. The creature will pick you up and give you a ride to the south side where the rocks are.\n\n===The Bowl===\nUse your [[pickaxe]] to get a [[Magic stone (Tears of Guthix)|magic stone]], and then use your [[chisel]] to craft it into a [[Stone bowl|bowl]]. One will be enough. Now, head east to climb back down and then go back to Juna. Give this bowl to her, and your quest is complete.\n\n'''Congratulations! Quest complete!'''\n\nYou can now reacquire the sapphire used when making your sapphire lantern by using the lantern with your lantern lens.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Tears of Guthix\n|image = [[File:Tears of Guthix reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{skill clickpic|Crafting|1,000}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*Ability to play the [[Tears of Guthix (minigame)]] once a week\n}}\n\n{{Tears of Guthix}}\n[[Category:Quests]]\n[[Category:Intermediate quests]]"], "Temple of Ikov": ["{{External|rs|rsc}}{{Has quick guide}}{{otheruses|the quest|the dungeon|Temple of Ikov (dungeon)}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Temple of Ikov\n|image = [[File:Temple of Ikov.png|300px]]\n|number = 28\n|members = Yes\n|release = 17 June [[2002]]\n|update = Latest RuneScape News (17 June 2002)\n|series = [[List of quest series#Mahjarrat quest series|Mahjarrat]]\n|difficulty = Experienced\n|developer = Paul Gower\n}}\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Speak to [[Lucien]] at the [[Flying Horse Inn]] in northwest [[Ardougne]] (north of the [[Ardougne Castle|castle]]).\n|difficulty = 3\n|length = Medium\n|requirements = *{{Skill clickpic|Thieving|42}} [[Thieving]] ([[boost]]able)\n*{{Skill clickpic|Ranged|40}} [[Ranged]]\n*The ability to defeat a level 84 enemy with Ranged\n|items = *A [[Yew bow|yew]], [[Magic bow|magic]], or [[dark bow]] (comp bows will work as well) (must be able to fire [[Ice arrows]], so [[crossbows]] won't work!)\n*A [[knife]] (or any [[slash weapon]])\n*20 unnoted [[limpwurt root]]s\n*A [[light source]]\n'''Recommended:'''\n(Law and air runes for [[Telekinetic Grab]] if not planning on banking during the quest) \n*[[Varrock teleport]]s\n*[[Ardougne teleport]]s (if [[Plague City]] has been completed)\n*[[Weight-reducing clothing]], such as the [[graceful outfit]], to stay below -1kg weight (saves a bank trip)\n*[[Ava's accumulator]] (however, this weighs 4kg)\n\n'''Do not bring anything unnecessary!

Equip the pendant - as it is required to open a gate in the temple - and bring a [[light source]] ('''cannot be''' a lit bug lantern).\n\nOn this first trip, you should bring only your [[slash weapon]]/[[knife]], light source and pendant. The [[Temple of Ikov (dungeon)|temple]] is located south of the [[Ranging Guild]], north of the Ardougne farm and east of the [[Fishing Guild]]; directly west of the [[Sorcerer's Tower]]. Climb down the ladder.\u00a0(''With additional weight reducing items like the [[graceful outfit]], [[penance gloves]], or the [[spottier cape]] from the [[Hunter]] [[skill]], it's possible to have all of the required quest items in your [[inventory]], removing the need to bank while still being below 0kg weight.)''\n\nOnce you're inside, if you don't already have [[boots of lightness]], go through the room (ignore the gates for now), and go down the stairs. It's dark, so you'll need a light source. Go through, slash the web, grab the boots of lightness and equip them.\u00a0At this point if you weigh more than -1&nbsp;kg, you may need to bank your items at the [[Ardougne]] bank (It should be noted that a player easily has enough time to drop their items, complete the task on the other side of the bridge, pass back over it and retrieve their items or drop them and telegrab them from the other side of the bridge when necessary if they do not wish to be restricted) closest to the temple. '''If you already have weight reducing gear, you can grab the limpwurt roots as well but make sure you're at most -1&nbsp;kg.'''\n\n'''Note: '''You no longer need a light source or knife once you have the boots of lightness.\n\n===The Temple of Ikov===\n[[File:Temple of Ikov bridge.png|thumb|220px|The weight bridge.]]\nEquip your Pendant of Lucien and boots of lightness then enter the north gates. You will come to a bridge; '''you must be below 0&nbsp;kg to cross!''' After crossing, open the large door and take the [[Lever (Temple of Ikov)|lever]] at the south end of the room. '''Warning:''' The lever weighs 0.1 kg. This may mean that you become 0kg after picking up the lever. Make sure to check your weight ''before'' crossing the bridge again, or you '''will''' fall into the lava.\n\nHead back to the dungeon's entrance. On the south-west wall from the ladder is the lever bracket. Use the fragment on the bracket and pull the lever. You can now use the south gate to access the ice chamber.\n\n'''Warning:''' If you place the lever but do not pull it and then leave the area, the lever will not be there when you return. You will have to cross the bridge again to collect it.\n[[File:Temple of Ikov ice arrow chests.png|thumb|220px|Obtaining the [[ice arrows]].]]\n''(It is recommended that [[Combat pure|pures]] or accounts with low [[Defence]] bank before the next part as you will be attacked by level 61 [[ice spider]]s. [[Food]] or [[Protect from Melee]] will help ward off the spiders' attacks.)''\n\nGo through the south gate to the ice chamber. Avoid the spiders, and run into the small offshoots of the main cave. Search each chest, one of them will contain 1-5 [[ice arrows]] (note, sometimes spam-clicking a chest containing arrows will grant you more). After you take them, they will [[Spawning|respawn]] randomly in either that chest or any other chest throughout the room, so keep searching until you have 20-30 arrows (or 10-20 if you have [[Ava's accumulator]]). Switching worlds will reset the chests (you must search every chest in order for the respawn to happen). Note that [[Ava's accumulator]] will return ice arrows to your arrow slot.\n\n===Fire Warrior of Lesarkus===\n[[File:Temple of Ikov fire warrior.png|thumb|220px|Duelling the [[Fire Warrior of Lesarkus]].]]\n:'''Note:''' If you already have all the necessary items, you don't need to return to the [[bank]].\n\nGo to the bank. Grab your best [[ranged armour]], the\u00a0[[pendant of lucien]], a\u00a0bow, [[ice arrows]], [[limpwurt root]]s and a [[Bandit's brew]] if you are choosing to [[boost]] to level 42 [[Thieving]]. When you are ready, go back to the [[Temple of Ikov (dungeon)|temple]].\n\nHead through the north gates once again. This time, continue north until you see a small alcove branching off to the north as the path turns west. Go inside the alcove, ignoring the trapdoor, and search the lever for traps (42 Thieving required), then pull it. Go back to the passage heading west, and follow it to a door. Enter it.\n\nGo through the room and attempt to open the door to the north. You will be stopped by the [[Fire Warrior of Lesarkus]], level 84. He will not attack until you either attack him first or finish dialogue with him. He fights with magic, so use [[Protect from Magic]]. He can '''only''' be damaged with ice arrows.\n\nIf you take too long to defeat him, he'll tell you to come back when you're stronger and will disappear, and you will have to start the fight again. Once he's dead, go through the next door.\n:'''Note:''' Once you kill the Fire Warrior, he does not need to be fought again.\n\nTalk to [[Winelda]] the witch. She will teleport you across the stream of lava if you give her 20 '''unnoted''' limpwurt roots. Give her the roots and you will cross the lava. '''(Note: all 20 limpwurt roots must be given at once to continue the quest.)'''\n\nRemove your pendant of lucien. Go past the skeletons. Once you see the [[Guardians of Armadyl]], push the wall directly below them to enter the barracks. Talk to them ('''remember to remove your pendant of lucien first, or else you will be attacked'''). You'll be given a choice of how you would like to finish the quest. Both choices have the same reward.\n\n===Side with the guardians (the good side)===\n[[File:Temple of Ikov staff of Armadyl.png|thumb|220px|The [[Staff of armadyl]] lying on a table.]]\nRemove your\u00a0[[pendant of lucien]], and talk to a Guardian of Armadyl by telling him that you seek the staff and are working for [[Lucien]]. Then, tell him that it's time for your yearly bath. They will tell you about their god, [[Armadyl]], who is a good god that they claim most [[Saradomin]]ists have never heard of because they only believe in three gods. Lucien has been after Armadyl's powerful staff for a long time. Lucien is really an evil [[Mahjarrat]], a very powerful race that follows [[Zamorak]]. They will tell you that you must kill Lucien to stop him from coming back. They will give you the [[Armadyl pendant]] once you agree to help them. This will prove that Lucien is no longer your friend and will allow you to kill him.\n\n===Side with Lucien (the bad side)===\nTry to take the [[Staff of armadyl]] on table, you will have to defeat at least one\u00a0Guardian of Armadyl\u00a0(Level 43) to pick up the staff.\n:'''Note:'''\u00a0Taking the staff whilst the Guardian walks far away from you will result in you taking the staff without being attacked.\n\n===Lucien's house===\nTo exit, you may teleport out, but it is recommended you take the longer route and obtain the [[shiny key]] (in case you wish to train [[combat]] on the monsters here in the future). Leave the treasure room and continue down the path to the south-west, past the level 82\u00a0[[lesser demon]]s, until you find a\u00a0shiny key. Take it, then backtrack until you find a ladder. Climb up the ladder and out the door to emerge outside\u00a0[[McGrubor's Wood]].\n\nMake your way to the building just outside the\u00a0[[Grand Exchange]]\u00a0western wall. The quickest route would be to take the [[fairy rings]] (his house is just south of the\u00a0fairy ring\u00a0{{Fairycode|dkr}}). If you don't yet have access to this either teleport to [[Edgeville]] and run east across the bridge then south, or teleport to [[Varrock]] then head to the west of the\u00a0Grand Exchange.\n[[File:Temple of Ikov - Lucien mind trick.gif|thumb|Lucien will use a mind trick on players who aren't wearing the pendant of Armadyl.]]\n====If you chose to side with the guardians====\nEnter the house, and put the [[Armadyl pendant]] on.

He will tell you that his crew of Corsairs has been inflicted with a curse and asks for your help. After you agree to help him, brief cut scene will show you where you can find the boat (the ship just south of the [[Rusty Anchor Inn]] in Port Sarim). Board the ship and speak to Captain Tock again to sail to [[Corsair Cove]].\n\nThere are four crew members to speak to: [[Arsen the Thief]], [[Cabin Boy Colin]], [[Gnocci the Cook]], and [[Ithoi the Navigator]]. Arsen and Colin are upstairs in the large hut immediately west of the dock and Gnocci is in the smaller hut slightly further to the west. Talk to any one of them and they will tell you they think they are cursed and that you should consult Ithoi, who is located in the large hut southwest of Corsair Cove (refer to the map for their exact locations).\n\n[[File:The Corsair Curse quest map.png|thumb|300px|A map of all the important locations visited during the quest.]]\nIf you haven't obtained a [[spade]] and [[tinderbox]] already, a tinderbox can be found beside Gnocci the Cook and a spade can be found planted in the sand under the big Tropical Tree southeast of Gnocci the Cook's hut, near the rocks (does not appear as a red dot in mini map). NOTE: The bank will not be accessible until this quest is completed.\n\nVisit Ithoi in his hut. He will also claim it is a curse and that there are many things that can cause them.\n\nInvestigate what may have caused the curse by speaking to Arsen, Colin, and Gnocci in any order; each will tell you they caused the curse with various events that occurred to each respectfully. Each crew member's claim will need to be investigated further.\n\n===Arsen's \"curse\"===\n[[File:Arsen the Thief chathead.png|left]]\n[[Arsen the Thief]] was asked by [[Captain Tock]] to explore some caves west of the cove. He was immediately spotted by the ogres as he climbed down, and in a panic, grabbed some loot and quickly escaped. He believes he may have stolen a sacred relic and the shamans have cursed his crew for stealing it.\n\nSpeak to Captain Tock located on the ship and ask him for the relic. As he has no use for it, he gives you the [[Ogre artefact (The Corsair Curse)|ogre artefact]].\n\nHead west of the cove and down the hole into the [[Corsair Cove Dungeon]]. Speak to [[Chief Tess]]. She will tell you that he simply grabbed one of her many tooth-picks and that her shamans have not cursed the crew.\n\nReturn to Arsen to explain what actually happened. Arsen is assured that the curse was not his fault.\n\n===Colin's \"curse\"===\n[[File:Cabin Boy Colin chathead.png|left]][[File:The_Corsair_Curse_-_Colin_sees_a_mermaid.png|thumb|250px|Colin sees a mermaid through Ithoi's telescope.]]\n[[Cabin Boy Colin]] believes he may have offended a mermaid after he saw one using Ithoi's telescope. He thinks perhaps the mermaid didn't like strangers shouting about her appearance and blowing kisses at her and she cursed the crew as a result.\n\nUse the telescope in Ithoi's hut and discover that the mermaid Colin was referring to is an [[ogre]] called [[Bugs]]. If you have completed [[Big Chompy Bird Hunting]], you will recognise him as [[Rantz]]'s son.\n\nReturn to Colin to explain what actually happened. Colin is assured that the curse was not his fault.\n\n===Gnocci's \"curse\"===\n[[File:Gnocci the Cook chathead.png|left]]\n[[File:The Corsair Curse - possessed doll location.png|thumb|383x383px|Dig here to find the Demonic Doll]]\n[[Gnocci the Cook]] will tell you that while fishing for food, he discovered \"Her\", a doll possessed by a demon, and buried it next to the tree where he was fishing. He believes that this demon cursed the crew and asks you to kill it.\n\nDig by the lump of sand to the west of Ithoi's hut where he buried the doll during the cutscene. You will discover it is a clockwork [[toy doll]]. If you have at least level 18 [[Crafting]], you will also say that you know how to make a doll just like it.\n\nReturn to Gnocci to explain what actually happened. Gnocci is assured that the curse was not his fault.\n\n===Traitor in the midst===\nAfter debunking [[Arsen]], [[Colin]], and [[Gnocci]]'s \"curses\", return to [[Captain Tock]] on the boat. He will explain to you that the curse began when he and [[Ithoi]] went away for a parlay and returned to find their crew sickly after eating dinner, with Ithoi shortly falling ill as well. As Ithoi was with Captain Tock at the time, he rules out the food as the cause of the curse.\n\nSpeak to Gnocci. You discover that he didn't cook dinner that night, as he was still traumatised from the \"possessed\" doll. He tells you that Ithoi cooked dinner that night instead before leaving for his parlay with Captain Tock. He will also rule out the food as the cause of the curse.\n\nNext, speak to Arsen. He will reveal that his brother, [[Francois]], told him that Ithoi may be dismissed from Tock's crew, as they have settled in the Cove and no longer need a navigator.\n\nNow, speak to Ithoi. Tell him that you heard of him cooking the meal that made the crew sick. He will believe you are accusing him of poisoning his crew and asks why you would think so. Tell him it is because the Captain is thinking of firing him and he will confess to the crime.

Lower levelled players should prepare for this fight, although he does splash quite often. NOTE: '''This fight is instanced and any items lost on death will be permanently gone'''.\n\nAfter killing Ithoi, leave his hut and return to Captain Tock. Captain Tock will ask what is happening now. Explain to him that Ithoi was killed for poisoning his crew. He will thank you and allow the crew members to rest and get better.

This is a reference to \"Zicke Zacke Zicke Zacke, Oi, Oi, Oi!\", which is the ending to a song called \"Ein Prosit,\" a traditional German toast to health and well-being. This chant is also used frequently on \"The Man Show\" before the hosts toast and drink their beer.\n* When returning to Captain Tock after speaking to the crew and debunking their theories. Captain Tock says, \"Arr, any sufficiently advanced technology be indistinguishable from demonic possession, that it be.\" This is a reference to {{wp|Clarke's three laws}} in which the 3rd law states \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\"\n* Captain Tock used to appear as a red dot on the mini map while aboard the ship. This bug has been fixed and he will now appear as a yellow NPC dot.\n* When the quest is completed, Captain Tock will be replaced by Cabin Boy Colin with the option to travel between Corsair Cove and Port Sarim.\n{{The Corsair Curse}}"], "The Depths of Despair": ["{{Has quick guide}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = The Depths of Despair\n|image = [[File:The Depths of Despair.png|300px]]\n|number = 134\n|members = Yes\n|release = 9 November [[2017]]\n|update = The Queen of Thieves & The Depths of Despair\n|series = [[Return of Xeric quest series|The Return of Xeric]]\n|difficulty = Novice\n|developer = Mod Ed\n}}\n'''The Depths of Despair''' is a [[quest]] that follows on from [[Client of Kourend]] in the [[Return of Xeric]] quest series.

He tells you that his eldest son, [[Artur Hosidius]], has gone missing, and that they are desperate for help in finding him. Select chat options 2 and 1 to agree to help him, and he will ask you to begin by talking to his family and servants.\n\nSpeak to [[Chef Olivia]] on the ground floor in the kitchens of Kandur's house. Olivia reveals that Artur and her are lovers, and he told her that he was looking for the original copy of the [[Accord of Twill]], and that he has been spending a lot of time researching in the [[Arceuus House Library]]. She refers you to a librarian, [[Galana]], who might be able to help you.\n\n===The Envoy to Varlamore===\nTravel to the [[Arceuus House Library]] and speak to [[Galana]], who is found in the north-eastern segment on the ground floor. She will suggest you find a book called [[Varlamore envoy|The Envoy to Varlamore]], whose location is random for each player. Ask her where it is and search the bookcases in that area until you find it -- each square in game is its own bookshelf, so be thorough. If you log out before finding the book, make sure to speak to [[Galana]] again, as the location may have changed.\n[[File:The Depths of Despair - Crabclaw Caves entrance.png|thumb|left|250px|The entrance to the Crabclaw Caves.]]\nRead the book, and you will discover that the original copy of the Accord was lost at sea, and that the ship carrying it sunk into the [[Crabclaw Caves]], whose entrance is found south of the [[Woodcutting Guild]], marked with the [[File:Dungeon map link icon.png]] icon. (If you don't read the book, a message saying \"You have no reason to go in there.\" will appear in the chat when you try to enter the Crabclaw Caves.)\n\n===The Crabclaw Caves===\nMake your way to the [[Crabclaw Caves]] (not [[Crabclaw Isle]]!). Follow the path east, south through a crevice, and then west past some obstacles through the caves to find a well. Along the path, there are some dead ends that contain [[King Sand Crab]]s, thus it is recommended to use the [[world map]] to find the correct path, especially if your combat level is low. As well, if your [[Hitpoints]] level and [[Agility]] level are both low, you might want to bring some food in case you fall while attempting to cross the stepping stones or rocks, and for the upcoming fight.\n[[File:The Depths of Despair - Fighting Sand Snake.png|thumb|250px|The player fights the Sand Snake.]]\nAt the end of the caves, climb down the tunnel entrance to find [[Artur Hosidius]]. He believes the chest further ahead contains the original Accord, but it is guarded by a [[Sand Snake]]. As he is not good at fighting, he asks you to kill it for him. Climb the rocks ahead, and kill the Sand Snake. It is weak to magic, so magical attacks are recommended to kill it quickly. Once you have killed the Sand Snake, search the chest, which contains the original [[Royal Accord of Twill]].\n\n===Finishing up===\nReturn to the [[Hosidius]] family's house, and speak to [[Lord Kandur]].

'''This often takes many tries and can easily take several minutes to find.''' When you find the talisman, a message will be displayed in your chat, so you are very unlikely to miss the drop. Once you have the talisman, take it to the Archaeological expert in the Exam Centre. He will say that it's a talisman of [[Zaros]] and is impressed.

Use your [[Invitation letter]] on a [[Digsite workman]] that's working ('''not''' on the workman that's standing next to the rocks at the winch nor the one with the wheelbarrow), and then use a [[rope]] on the winch to gain access to the sublevels of the Digsite.\n[[File:Digsite Dungeon Map.png|thumb|200px|[[Digsite Dungeon]]]]\nClimb down the rope by operating the winch (requires 10 [[Agility]]). Grab an\u00a0[[arcenia root]] near the rope, and go east until you see some large bricks blocking the way to a room to the south. \"Search\" the bricks, and then go back to the surface. It is impossible to pass through until you clear the path.\n\nReturn to the surface, and head towards the north-eastern winch, a little bit south of the level 3 digsite from before. Use another rope and go down, there you will find [[Doug Deeping]]. Speak to him and ask him how you can move a large pile of rocks. He will give you a [[chest key (Digsite)|chest key]] to be used on the chest in the tent where you got your [[panning tray]]. If you haven't already, grab an [[arcenia root]] while you are there.\n[[File:Book on chemicals detail.png|left|60px]]\nYou need to mix [[ammonium nitrate]], [[nitroglycerin]], [[ground charcoal]], and arcenia root to get the [[chemical compound]] that can blow up the bricks blocking the path in the western winch. (Although not needed, the recipe for this compound is described in the\u00a0[[book on chemicals]], which can be found in one of the bookshelves in the Exam Centre.)\n*Go open the chest near the panning site to get chemical powder.\n*Use your [[trowel]] on the barrel (marked with a skull and bones if you rotate the camera around) west of the tent with the chest to open it. Use your [[vial]] on the barrel to get an unidentified liquid. '''You take 25 damage if you drop the vial!'''\n*Search the specimen tray north of the tent with a [[specimen jar]] in your inventory till you find [[charcoal]]. Grind it with a [[pestle and mortar]] to get ground charcoal.\n*:'''Note:''' If planning to do [[Desert Treasure]], get a second charcoal to save time, but '''drop it''' while you grind the other, or else they will both be ground.\n*Show the chemical powder to the archaeological expert in the [[Exam Centre]] to learn that it's ammonium nitrate, and then show (be careful not to left click on the empty option) the unidentified liquid to him to learn that it's nitroglycerin.\n*Mix the nitroglycerin and the ammonium nitrate.

You must approach the villager from behind, but if it doesn't work you don't lose your payment, and can just talk to urchin again.\n*'''3rd villager''' - Go back and get the [[blackjack]] from Ali the Operator by asking him for help. Then lure a villager, knock them out with the blackjack, and finally pick their pocket (all options are right click).\n\n===The second job===\nNow, [[Ali the Operator]] wants you to steal the mayor's wife's [[jewels]] from the safe in their villa. Ali the Operator will give you a key to the front door. Use the [[fake beard]] with the [[Kharidian headpiece]] you got from [[Ali Morrisane]], or buy the two pieces from the [[general store]] in [[Pollnivneach]], to make a [[desert disguise]]. Put on your [[gloves]] and your disguise. Hide behind the huge cactus nearby the mayor's villa (northeast of the bar). When it tells you that it is safe to go in that nobody is home, use your key on the door to go in.\n[[File:The Feud - cracking the safe.png|thumb|220px|Cracking the safe.]]\nSearch the study desk, and you will find a [[Note (numbers)|note]] with a riddle and several numbers written on it. Go up the staircase and search the bed. You will find another [[Note (Fibonacci)|note]] with \"Fibonacci\" written on it. Then, search the landscape picture hanging beside the bed and you discover the safe. You must click '''1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8''', on the dial, which is the famous {{Wp|Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence}}. '''<u>The dial is set to 0 so you have to enter 1 twice since 1+1=2</u>'''. The numbers progress from 1-9 (clockwise). Once the combination is entered, the safe will open and you can take the jewels.\n:'''Note:''' If you have no [[inventory]] space, you will have to enter this sequence again.\n\n===The third job===\n[[File:The Feud - Ali the Hag.png|thumb|220px|Talking to the [[Ali the Hag|Hag]].]]\nGive the [[jewels]] to [[Ali the Operator]], and he requests you find the traitor. Talk to a [[Menaphite Thug]] gang member about it, and he says, ''\"It must be Traitorous Ali.\"'' Go back to the Ali the Operator, and you're asked to kill him. Now, go talk to Ali the [[Ali the Barman|barman]] to find out that the beer on the table belongs to the traitor. Go talk to [[Ali the Hag]] up the hill to the northwest of the town, and she will make a poison for you if you get her a [[snake]].\n{{Clear}}\n[[File:The Feud - snake charming.png|thumb|left|220px|Charming the [[snake]].]]\nNow, go around the back of the pub, and put some [[coins]] in the snake charmer's money pot. He will give you a [[snake charm]] and a [[snake basket]]. Use ('''not''' Play) the snake charm on a desert snake, which can be found north of Ali the Operator's tent. You should automatically catch the snake, but may have to try a few times.\n\nNote: Even if you have received a snake charm from Ali the Snake Charmer from the quest [[Rat Catchers]], he will give you another (provided you have two free inventory spaces).\n{{Clear}}\n[[File:The Feud - pouring hot sauce.png|thumb|220px|Pouring the [[red hot sauce]] on the trough.]]\nOnce you've brought the snake back to [[Ali the Hag]], she will tell you the second item she needs is fresh [[Ugthanki dung|camel dung]]. Go to [[Ali the Kebab seller]], located just north-west of the well in the center of town, and ask for his [[red hot sauce]]. Take this to the camel shop, and use it on the food trough. Some '''dung''' appears - use a [[bucket]] on it. You must be wearing gloves to pick it up. You might get '''green dung''', this is not the type you want, and it is totally random which '''dung''' you get, so keep trying. You want the '''nice brown dung''' or the '''Ugthanki dung.'''\n:'''Note:''' The camel automatically eats from the trough after hot sauce is poured into it, dung appears a few seconds after.\n[[File:The Feud - poisonining drink.png|thumb|220px|Pouring the hag's poison onto Traitorous Ali's drink.]]\n:'''Note:''' You may want to gather three or four more Ugthanki dung, since it is used in [[My Arm's Big Adventure]] and possibly needed for [[Forgettable Tale of a Drunken Dwarf]].\n:'''Note:''' If you repeatedly add hot sauce to the trough it will disappear for a short time.\nTake the dung to Ali the Hag and she'll give you some poison to kill [[Traitorous Ali]].\n\nGo to the pub, use the poison on the table with the beer, and then\u00a0go\u00a0back to Ali the Operator.\n\n===Finishing up===\n[[File:The Feud - Tough Guy safespot.png|thumb|220px|The [[safespot]] for the Tough Guy.]]\nPrepare yourself for the fight. [[Ali the Operator]] now tells you to talk to the [[Menaphite Leader]] (he magically appears outside the tent). You decide to kill the leader as he's just a little crazy with world domination schemes! A level 75 [[Tough Guy]] appears to fight you. Swiftly kill him! You can lure him behind the table inside the Menaphite Tent and kill him.\n[[File:The Feud - Bandit champion safespot.png|thumb|220px|This is the ideal safespot for the [[bandit champion]].]]\nTalk to a [[villager]], and they are angry with you for upsetting the balance of power and will tell you that you need to deal with the [[Bandit Leader]] too. He's just northwest of the village (just near the bandit side of village). Talk to the bandit leader, and you will tell him to leave town or else. The bandit leader tries to pay you, but you're firm about him leaving. He will not leave without a fight. Now, kill the level 70 [[bandit champion]] that the bandit leader summons. The player may [[safespot]] him behind the crate near the rug merchant (alternatively lure him into the tent to the east of the bandit leader and range/mage over the chairs).\nTalk to the villagers to find out that they are still ungrateful!\n:'''Note:''' You must speak to a villager, otherwise the mayor will not appear.\n\nNext, talk to [[Ali the Mayor]]. He is a little more grateful about the results of your deeds. You can find him at the well, in the center of the village. He will tell you of [[Ali Morrisane]]'s nephew. Now, go back to Ali Morrisane to claim the reward.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Feud\n|image = [[File:The Feud reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{Skill clickpic|Thieving|15,000}} [[Thieving]] [[experience]]\n*500 [[Coins]]\n*A [[willow blackjack]] (as a drop from the [[tough guy]])\n*The [[desert disguise]]\n*Access to the [[Rogue Trader]] [[Minigames|minigame]].\n*An [[adamant scimitar]] (as a drop from the [[bandit champion]])\n*A glass of [[beer]] (by telling the [[Ali the Barman|bartender]] that the beer is poisoned)\n*Can now buy [[blackjack]]s from [[Ali Morrisane]] after unlocking the Rogue Trader minigame.\n*Can now steal from [[villager]]s, [[Bandit (Pollnivneach)|bandits]] and [[Menaphite Thug]]s.\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\n*[[My Arm's Big Adventure]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*The combination to the mayor's safe is the first 6 terms of the {{Wp|Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence}}.\n*Even though the [[bandit champion]] wields a [[steel scimitar]], he will drop an [[adamant scimitar]].\n*If you decide to go back to the urchin and pay him, you can ask him about various aspects of [[Pollnivneach]], including the gangs, and the town itself.\n*When you talk to [[Ali the Barman]] about [[Traitorous Ali]], you discover there are no toilets in [[Gielinor]].\n**This is no longer true, since there is an outhouse next to the general store on [[Fossil Island]].\n*While completing the quest, your character will realise that the main reason [[Ali Morrisane]] sent you to Pollnivneach was so that you would buy a [[desert disguise]] from him as well as the camels and hot sauce, thus proving that Ali Morrisane is, in fact, the greatest merchant in all of RuneScape.\n*Upon completion of the quest Ali Morrisane refers to his nephew as \"Baba\", making a reference to ''{{Wp|Ali Baba|Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves}}''.\n*When speaking to [[Ali the Hag]], she will tell you that you can't call her \"Al\".

You will likely only use one prayer potion killing the 10 trolls before the fight. It is recommended you bring and have [[yak armour]] and your [[Fremennik shield (The Fremennik Isles)|shield]] equipped before you begin and at all times, as repairing one of the bridges can be dangerous, and running to the eastern side of the northern-most island can be fatal without these items. The quest is also relatively short if you gather all the items beforehand, and you'll likely only need 5-6 good [[food]] prior to the boss.\n\n===Area overview===\nThe Fremennik Isles are a collection of islands interconnected by bridges. The map below shows the islands and their interconnections. There are two major villages on the islands: [[Neitiznot]] and [[Jatizso]].\n\nThe teleport locations show the landing docks that can be reached from the most northern dock in [[Rellekka]] using the appropriate ferry operator.\n\nThe numbers on the map represent the following locations relevant during the quest:\n[[File:The Fremennik Isles quest map.png|frame|centre|Quest map]]\n#The court of [[King Gjuki Sorvott IV]].\n#The court of [[Mawnis Burowgar|King Mawnis Burowgar]].\n#A bridge that needs repairs.\n#Another bridge that needs repairs.\n#Entrance to the [[Ice Troll Caves]] for the final battle.\n:'''<font color=\"red\">Warning:</font>''' Do not go to the northern islands without [[food]], or you may die.\n\nBoth villages have a bank that can be used.\n\nAt any time during the quest, it is possible to travel around all islands.\n:'''Note:''' If you are simply starting this quest for access to Neitiznot bring a [[raw tuna]] and 8 [[tin ore]]s if [[Mining]] level 1-9, 7 pieces of [[coal]] if mining level 10-54, 6 [[mithril ore]]s if 55+ and speak to King Gjuki Sorvott IV.\n\n===King Gjuki Sorvott IV===\n'''''Items needed for this part of the quest:''' [[raw tuna]], 8 [[tin ore]]s, 7 pieces of [[coal]], or 6 [[mithril ore]]s (ores can be noted).''[[File:The Fremennik Isles - Jatizso court.png|thumb|220px|King Sorvott's court]]\nTo start the quest, talk to [[Mord Gunnars]] at the most northern dock in [[Rellekka]] to be taken to [[Jatizso]].\n\nTalk to [[King Gjuki Sorvott IV]] in the checkered floor room. His [[HRH Hrafn|cat]] will intervene. The king asks you to get the cat a [[raw tuna]].\n:'''Note:''' The tuna can be fished just south on the pier or bought in the store just to the northeast of the king (pot icon on minimap).\n\nGive the tuna to the king's cat, and talk to the king.\n\nGive the king the [[ores]] you are assigned (8 [[Tin ore|tin]] 1-9, 7 pieces of [[coal]] if 10-54, 6 [[Mithril ore|mithril]] if 55+). If needed, these ores can be mined at [[Jatizso mine|the cave]] below the village. It is accessible by exiting the west gate and going northeast. Enter the dungeon, and mine the ores. Coal ore also can be bought from [[Hring Hring]]. The king's reward for the ores consists of some [[coins]].\n\n'''Take the [[jester]] clothes from the chest behind the king's throne.'''\n\nFrom Rellekka, travel to [[Neitiznot]] using the ferry operated by Mord's wife, [[Maria]]. Maria can be found on the north eastern dock in Rellekka along with Mord Gunnars.\n\n===King Mawnis Burowgar===\n'''''Items needed for this part of the quest:''' [[Silly jester costume]]''\n\nTalk to [[Slug Hemligssen]], behind the bank, and say, ''\"Free stuff please.\"'' He'll give the assignment to listen in only while wearing the [[jester outfit]].\n[[File:FI jester controls.png|thumb|300px|The player entertaining the Burgher.]]\nTalk to [[Mawnis Burowgar]] in the building just south of the bank while wearing the jester costume and entertain him\u2014do everything he says using the jester control panel shown in the picture.

When missing ropes, go kill some [[yak]]s, and take the [[hair]] drop to the [[spinning wheel]] in the village to obtain a rope.\n\nGo and cut eight [[arctic pine logs]], and split them in the stump in the middle of the village.\n:'''Note:''' If you do not have 56 [[Woodcutting]] to split these logs, you may buy them off other players, and it will still allow you to continue the quest.\n\nTell Mawnis and receive another 1,500 coins.\n\nSpeak to the guard [[Thakkrad Sigmundson]], and you will be able to repair the bridges.\n:'''<font color=\"red\">Warning:</font>''' Be warned; you may be attacked by high-level, hard-hitting trolls in the next step. Bring [[food]]/[[armour]] if necessary.\n[[File:The Fremennik Isles reparing bridge.png|thumb|220px|Repairing the bridge.]]\nGet a [[knife]], eight [[split log]]s, and eight ropes from the bank (or buy one from the general supply [[NPC]] in the [[bank]]). Travel over the first set of bridges to get to the broken ones further north to repair the bridges (right-click). You will have to travel past trolls to get there, some of which can use [[Ranged]]. Each bridge only needs one repair. '''Turn on [[Protect from Missiles]] <u>before</u> you start repairing the eastern bridge.''' You cannot activate [[protection prayers]] while repairing, meaning that the [[Ice troll female|Ice Troll females]] can inflict heavy ranged damage on you while you are defenceless. Keep Protect from Missiles '''ON''' while repairing the bridge; all damage that would have been dealt by projectiles while repairing will be applied to you as you exit the bridge.\n\nGo back to talk to the king ([[Mawnis Burowgar]]) again; he'll pay another 1,500 coins for repairing the bridges. Now, the request is to investigate the [[Ice Troll Caves|troll caves]], but first, you need to make sure that the other [[King Gjuki Sorvott IV|king]] does not take the raid on the trolls in the wrong way.\n\n===Tax collector===\n'''''Items needed:''' 5,000 [[gold coins]] (optional)''\n\nUse the boat to go back to [[Rellekka]], and use [[Mord]]'s ferry service to return to [[King Gjuki Sorvott IV]] on [[Jatizso]].\n\nKing Gjuki Sorvott IV requires a tax collector for his new window tax, which needs to pay for the expenses of the army.\n\nCollect taxes from the following people:\n#[[Hring Hring]] or [[Raum Urda-Stein]] at the armourer's hut (8,000 [[coins]])\u00a0\n#[[Skuli Myrka]] at the weaponsmith hut (6,000 [[coins]])\n#[[Flosi Dalksson]] or [[Keepa Kettilon]]\u00a0at the fish shop/[[general store]] (5,000 [[coins]])\n#[[Vanligga Gastfrihet]] at the eating hall (5,000 [[coins]]) ''(Offer to pay her taxes for her; this provides the capability to trade in black market yak goods after the quest.)''\nGo back to King Sorvott, who now requires a tax collector for the newly invented \"facial hair tax.\"\n\nNow, collect from:\n#[[Raum Urda-Stein]]\u00a0(armour trader)\n#Hring Hring (ore trader, in the same building as [[Raum Urda-Stein|Raum]])\n#Skuli Myrka (weapon trader at the anvil North of [[Raum Urda-Stein|Raum]])\n#Flosi Dalksson (raw fish seller in the general store)\n#[[Keepa Kettilon]] (cooked fish seller in the general store)\nThe tax bag now contains 29,000 coins. The same taxpayer options apply as in the previous tax collection round. Return to the king.\n\nThe taxes are finally enough. Now, the king requires more spying assistance. So, its time to return to [[Slug Hemligssen|Slug]] the spymaster in [[Neitiznot]].\n\n'''Note:''' If you do not have a [[Fremennik shield (The Fremennik Isles)|Fremennik shield]] already and don't have a [[bronze nail]] in your bank, buy one [[Copper ore|copper]] and one [[tin ore]] from Hring Hring to make a [[bronze bar]] at the clay forge in Neitiznot (or use [[Superheat Item]]). When returning to Jatizso later in quest, use the anvil to make some bronze nails.\n\n===The Jester Part 2===\n'''''Items needed:''' [[Silly jester costume]]''\n\nReturn to [[Slug Hemligssen|Slug]] once more, only to get an assignment as jester again.\n\nA rough capture of the guards exchange:\n:<font color=\"blue\">What do you think of the new Burgher's Champion?</font>\n:''He/She seems honourable and courageous to me.''\n:<font color=\"blue\">What about their collaboration with King Sorvott?</font>\n:''Well, I trust Mord Gunnars and he works for the King.''\n:<font color=\"blue\">And the Champion was helping you to repair the bridges.</font>\n:''Well yes.

The answers are:\n#'''Etceteria'''\n#'''Some potions'''\n#'''I have been helping'''\nSlug is pleased with the answers and pays another 2,500 coins. Then, he suggests to visit [[King Gjuki Sorvott IV]] and give an update on the spying progress.\n\n===Traditional Fremennik rites===\n'''''Items needed:''' A set of [[yak-hide armour]] '''OR''' 3 [[yak-hide]]s (can be obtained on [[Neitiznot]]), 15 [[gold coins]], a [[needle]] and some [[thread]]. You will also need a large [[Fremennik round shield]] '''OR''' 2 [[arctic pine logs]], one [[bronze nail]], a [[hammer]], and a [[rope]].''\n\n[[King Gjuki Sorvott IV]] gets an update that he is not prepared for, but he won't listen to sound advice.\n\nHe will give you a decree that you need to deliver to [[Mawnis Burowgar]].\n\nHop islands again to talk to Mawnis, who is obviously disappointed in learning the decree from King Sorvott. As leader of his troops, go through the ancient [[Neitiznot]] warrior rites.\n:'''Note:''' You can skip the making of the shield and armour by having all three items in your inventory and continuing to speak to the king.\n\nFirst, [[Thakkrad Sigmundson]] will tell you to make [[yak-hide armour]]. Get three [[yak-hide]]s, and have them cured by Thakkrad for a fee of 5 coins per hide. Take a [[needle]] and [[thread]] from bank or the nearby shop, and craft the [[cured yak-hide]]s into [[yak-hide chaps]] (1 hide) and into a [[yak-hide body]] (2 hides). Each hide gives 32 [[Crafting]] [[experience]]. Thakkrad states that the armour is ideal for protection from the [[Ice troll|trolls]]' granite clubs.\n\nTalk to King Burowgar again to learn how to make a large [[Fremennik round shield]]. This shield is ideal for protection from stones that are thrown by the trolls.\n\nMaking the shield requires two [[arctic pine logs]], one [[bronze nail]], a [[hammer]], and a [[rope]]. Make the shield on the [[Woodcutting]] stump located east of bank. Make sure to have a hammer in the inventory. Making a shield gives 34 Crafting experience.\n:'''Note:''' If you do not have 56 Woodcutting to make this shield, you may buy the shield off other players, and it will still allow you to continue the quest.\n\nReturn to King Burowgar one more time, and he will make you the champion of Neitiznot and give you the assignment to kill the [[Ice Troll King]] and deliver his head.\n\n===The Troll King===\n'''''Items needed:''' A set of [[yak-hide armour]], a large [[Fremennik round shield]], [[food]], and [[armour]].''\n:'''Note:''' The [[Troll King]] can only be killed effectively with [[Melee]]; '''do not use''' [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]].\n\n[[Ice troll]]s resemble their mountainous counterparts. The key difference is that ice trolls wield [[Melee]] and [[Ranged weapons]] with a special effect that can hit through [[Defence]]. Occasionally, the ice troll can hit as if the player wears no armour and has a Defence level of 1. Unlike the [[Verac's set]] effect, however, the weapons do not hit through [[protection prayers]]. The [[yak-hide armour]] and the [[Fremennik round shield]] help a lot to reduce the frequency and the damage of the special effect from the ice trolls' weapons. The traditional Fremennik armour has reasonable Defence against both Melee and Ranged attacks. The only extra items to bring are [[gloves]], [[boots]], a [[helmet]], an [[amulet]], a [[cape]], and a [[Melee weapon]] of your choice.\n[[File:The Fremennik Isles honour guard and trolls.png|thumb|220px|Fighting the ice trolls alongside the honour guard.]]\nIf you're planning on using Melee without wearing yak-hide armour and the Fremennik shield (not recommended), bring a [[super potion set]], [[prayer potion]]s and good [[food]] as you may take heavy damage. Taking a [[ring of life]] should be considered as well as an emergency teleport (e.g. the [[Ectophial]], a [[teleport crystal]] or any [[magic tablet]]).\n\nGo to the eastern part of the most northern isle. As you get closer to the [[Ice Troll Caves|dungeon]], the number of hard hitting trolls keeps increasing. Use [[Protect from Missiles]]/[[Protect from Melee|Melee]] (preferably Protect from Melee since the melee trolls do more damage than the ranged ones) to reduce the amount of damage taken, depending on which trolls are approaching or attacking you. Run past the trolls. When you get to the eastern side of the northernmost area, the trolls will not follow you. You can rest before you enter the cave to get back your run energy for the final part in the [[Ice Troll Caves|troll cave]].\n\nAfter entering the eastern cave entrance, a cutscene follows. The men from [[King Burowgar]] will help with killing 10 trolls before you can cross the bridge to the south to assault the [[Ice Troll King]]. Their support can be useful as the trolls are in a [[multicombat area]] with ranged and melee trolls teaming up to inflict a lot of damage. The [[Ice troll male|troll males]], [[Ice troll grunt|grunts]] and [[Ice troll runt|runts]] use Melee while the [[Ice troll female|females]] use Ranged.\n[[File:The Fremennik Isles boss fight.png|thumb|220px|Fighting the Ice Troll King.]]\nTalk to [[Bork Sigmundson]] near the cave entrance, and he will give you up to ten [[tuna]]s, two 4-dose [[strength potion]]s, and at least three 3-dose prayer potions upon request. If there is not enough inventory space, then the player gets enough to fill the pack and does not get any more. Players can make only one request for each supply. Simply talk to him. This should give you enough potions if you're meleeing with protection prayers and the appropriate Fremennik armour.\nA useful strategy is to let the warriors attack the trolls and finish off 10 that are nearly dead. It's faster this way, and you avoid wasting food or prayer. Another useful strategy is meleeing female thrower trolls with Protect from Missiles; the melee trolls can get stuck on obstacles and are less likely to interfere.\n\nKill the 10 trolls required to cross the bridge. A message in the screen will appear stating that the bridge to the [[Ice Troll King]] can be used. Leaving the cave will not revoke your access to the Ice Troll King, so restock on supplies if you need to.\n\nWhen crossing the bridge, a short cut scene shows the Troll King moving towards you. He will land the first strike, so turn on the [[Protect from Magic]] prayer before crossing bridge or while the cut scene is playing, and top up prayer if needed.\n:'''<font color=\"red\">Warning:</font>''' This fight takes place in an [[instanced]] room, so if you are killed, you cannot pick up dropped items.\n:'''<font color=\"red\">Warning:</font>''''' When fighting the final boss, don't use Protect from Melee (Protect from Magic is preferable).''\n\nThe Troll King has a [[Combat level]] of 122 and uses a powerful mix of attacks (Melee, Ranged, [[Magic]] and teleport); turn on Protect from Magic and you won't get hit much. Wearing yak hide armour and using the Fremennik shield while meleeing with Protect from Magic will decrease his damage significantly. '''Do not''' use Protect from Melee against the troll king for he will use a strong knockback attack for as long as you have it activated, making you unable to attack him.\n[[File:The Fremennik Isles boss defeated.png|thumb|220px|Neitiznot's champion claims the troll's head as proof of victory.]]\nAfter killing the Troll King, decapitate the head from the body. (You do not need any particular weapon/[[knife]] for this step, you simply pull it off). If you die with the troll king head in your inventory, you do not need to kill the king again; just return to the spot to find the troll king with a new head for you to take.\n\nTeleport away, or return the way you came. Return to [[Neitiznot]] to talk to King Burowgar. He will give his [[helm of neitiznot]] in return for the [[Troll King's head]]. After taking two choices for a 10,000 experience reward to any one of [[Attack]], [[Strength]], [[Defence]] or [[Hitpoints]], the quest is complete.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Fremennik Isles\n|image = [[File:The Fremennik Isles reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = *{{Skill clickpic|Construction|5,000}} [[Construction]] [[experience]]\n*{{Skill clickpic|Crafting|5,000}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Woodcutting|10,000}} [[Woodcutting]] experience\n*Two lots of {{Skill clickpic|Combat|10,000}} [[Combat]] experience (choose between {{Skill clickpic|Strength}} [[Strength]], {{Skill clickpic|Attack}} [[Attack]], {{Skill clickpic|Defence}} [[Defence]] or {{Skill clickpic|Hitpoints}} [[Hitpoints]]).\n}}\n*A [[Fremennik]] royal helm known as the [[helm of neitiznot]], which is the equivalent of a [[berserker helm]] with a +3 [[Prayer bonus]], slightly better [[Magic]] and crush [[Defence]], and no negative bonuses.

Although the last name ending in \"-ssen\" which is more common in Norway/Denmark e.g., 'Anderssen / Larssen' as Sweden uses \"-sson\" e.g., 'Andersson / Svensson'.\n*The watchtowers between the two islands have a special [[cutscene]] when spoken to, in which they are yelling insults to each other which are quotes from {{Wp|Monty Python and the Holy Grail}}, such as \"Your mother was a hamster. ... And your father smelled of elderberries.\"\n*The [[ice troll]]s used to have fairly decent drops. The [[Rune equipment|rune items]] ([[Rune kiteshield|kiteshield]] and [[Rune warhammer|warhammer]]) are the few remaining items that players with high level [[Smithing]] can sell in modest volume. Their complaints resulted in a significant downgrade of the drop list from Ice Trolls.\n*If a\u00a0[[catspeak amulet]] is worn, the player is able to understand what [[HRH Hrafn]] is saying during an early cutscene.\n*If you already have enough ores in your bank when tasked with acquiring them early in the quest, you will have a unique exchange with [[Thorkel Silkbeard]].\n*Speaking to Mawnis Burowgar with an inventory of ropes before he tells you that you need to get ropes to repair the bridges will result in a humorous conversation in which he accuses you of being a witch while you defend that you are a ropes salesperson.\n*[[Morten Holdstrom]] (near main gate to Neitiznot) eats {{Wp|surstr\u00f6mming}}, a Swedish delicacy consisting of fermented Baltic herring.\n*The name of the cook on Jatizso is named [[Vanligga Gastfrihet]], which is Swedish and could be roughly translated to \"Kind Hospitality\".\n*In the music 'Norse Code' (playing while in Jatizso), the high pitch flute plays the {{Wp|Morse code}} letters for \"'''RuneScape'''\". The code is as follows: '''.-. ..- -. . ... -.-. .- .--. .'''\n*When the quest was first released, one of the NPCs used the word ''damn'', which was originally a censored word when used by players. It was later changed to ''blasted''.\n*Some of the quest is similar to the epic Anglo-Saxon story {{Wp|Beowulf}}, as you have to cut off the head of the [[Troll King]] in the quest, but in the story Beowulf had to cut off the head of the monster {{Wp|Grendel}}'s\u00a0mother.\n*Neitiznot is ruled by a Burgher, while Jatizso is ruled by a King. Together, these make a Burgher King, a pun about ''{{Wp|Burger King}}'', a real-life global fast food chain. This could also be a reference the English King Henry VII, whose nickname was the Burgher King.\n\n{{The Fremennik Isles}}\n[[Category:Fremennik|Fremennik Isles]]"], "The Fremennik Trials": ["{{External|rs}}\n{{Has quick guide}}\n{{Infobox quest\n|name = The Fremennik Trials\n|number = 62\n|image = [[File:The Fremennik Trials.png|300px]]\n|members = Yes\n|release = 2 November [[2004]]\n|update = The Fremennik Trials\n|series = [[List of quest series#Fremennik series|Fremennik]]\n|difficulty = Intermediate\n|developer = James B\n}}\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Speak to [[Brundt the Chieftain]] (located in the longhall) in [[Rellekka]].\n|difficulty = 2\n|description = Council workmen have at last found the time to make repairs to the footbridge that connects Kandarin with the Barbarian town of Rellekka.\n\nDo you have what it takes to impress the barbarians who live there, and perhaps be welcomed as an honorary member of their clan?\n|length = Long\n|requirements = *If crafting the lyre:\n**Level 25 {{Skill clickpic|Fletching}} [[Fletching]]\n**Level 40 {{Skill clickpic|Woodcutting}} [[Woodcutting]]\n**Level 40 {{Skill clickpic|Crafting}} [[Crafting]]\n*'''OR'''\n**Players kill [[Lanzig]] to obtain the lyre ''(1/17 chance)''\n*Ability to defeat a level-69 [[NPC]]\n*Ability to defeat a fairly strong warrior without [[armour]], [[weapons]], or [[spells]]\n'''Recommended:'''\n*Level 48 {{Skill clickpic|Agility}} [[Agility]] (not necessary; however, it may help you when locating the [[Draugen]])\n|items = *5,252 [[coins]]\n*1 [[beer]] (obtainable during quest)\n*1 [[raw shark]] (can be bought from [[Rufus' Meat Emporium]] in [[Canifis]]), [[manta ray]], or [[sea turtle]] ('''Note:''' This is '''REQUIRED''' all the way in [[Rellekka]]; obtain the shark '''BEFORE''' going there, or prepare for a lot of walking.)\n*[[Tinderbox]] \n*If crafting Lyre yourself:\n**Woodcutting [[axe]]\n** [[Knife]]\n**[[Potato]] (obtainable during quest) \n**[[Onion]] (obtainable during quest) \n**[[Cabbage]] (obtainable during quest) \n'''Recommended:'''\n*Some [[food]]\n*[[Armour]] and a [[weapon]] ('''Note:''' Ranged is '''NOT''' effective)\n*3-5 [[prayer potions]]\n*3-5 super energy potions\n*A [[super combat potion]] or [[super potion set|super set]]\n*Some [[Camelot teleport]] runes (and [[Teleport to House]] runes if you have your house located at [[Rellekka]]).\n|kills = *[[Koschei the deathless]]\n*[[Draugen]] ''(level 69)''\n'''OPTIONAL'''\n*[[Lanzig]] ''(level 48)'' (multiple times)\n}}\n'''Note:''' If you start the quest, you will not be able to use [[Peer the Seer]] to bank your items, unless the player completes the easy [[Fremennik Diary|Fremennik Achievement Diary]], which re-enables his [[deposit box]] functionality.\n\n==Walkthrough==\n[[File:Brundt the Chieftain chathead.png|left]]\n[[File:The Fremennik Trials - Talking to Chieftan Brundt.png|thumb|200px|Talking to Brundt, the start point for the quest.]]\nBegin the quest by speaking to [[Brundt|Brundt the Chieftain]].

The cherrybomb will then explode, distracting the Fremennik and allowing you to switch the contents.\n\nTalk to Manni again once you have switched the contents.

The first thing you need is a lyre.\n\nThere are two ways to get a [[lyre]]:\n\n*'''Option 1:''' The player can kill [[Lanzig]], [[Borrokar]], [[Lensa]] or [[Freidir]], who can drop the lyre. However, it is recommended to only kill Lanzig for the lyre, as Borrokar and Freidir have an extremely low drop rate, while Lanzig has an uncommon drop rate for the lyre. Lanzig respawns in approximately 18 seconds and can be killed quicker by world hopping. For mage and range users, you can use the fire in the middle of the room (as a blockade between you and Lanzig) to [[safe-spot]]. You can also safe-spot Lanzig by opening the door east, attacking Lanzig, then going two steps east of the door to kill him from a distance.\n[[File:Lanzig location.png|thumb|left|Lanzig's location.]]\n*'''Option 2:''' Make a lyre yourself. First, grab a [[potato]], [[cabbage]], and [[onion]] from the vegetable patch in [[Rellekka]] before you leave. Once you leave the gates, head east until you find a [[Swaying tree]], and cut a branch off it. You will need an axe (blessed will not work) and a [[Woodcutting]] level of 40 in order to cut the tree, and a Crafting level of 40 to make the unfinished lyre.\n\nThen you will then need to string the unfinished lyre, but unfortunately only golden wool will work. Head southeast of the tree until you find several golden sheep and a golden tree. Near them will be a troll called [[Lalli]], who will initially think you want the apples when you want the wool. He will tell you that he already gave it to another human, so go find him.\n\n'''Note: You MUST start the trial by speaking with [[Olaf the Bard]] BEFORE speaking with [[Lalli]] or else he will not tell you about the other human.'''\n\n[[File:The Fremennik Trials - Cutting the Swaying Tree.png|thumb|230px|Cutting the Swaying tree.]]\n\nThe other human is [[Askeladden]], who is located outside the long hall in Rellekka. Talk to him and he will give you a [[pet rock]] which he fooled Lalli with. Return to Lalli with the rock, but he will refuse it because the rocks might have baby rocks, so tell him that you can make a delicious rock soup with it.\n\n[[File:The Fremennik Trials - Olaf's Trial Map.png|thumb|left|220px|Lalli's located at the Golden Apple Tree; Fossegrimen will enchant your finished lyre at the Strange Altar]]\n\nUse the potato, cabbage, onion, and rock on Lalli's stew, which is just outside Lalli's cave home. Ask Lalli to taste it; he will like it and give you some golden fleece. The fleece will need to be strung into a ball of wool; even though there is a spinning wheel in Rellekka, you cannot use that until the quest is finished, so you will need to go to Seer's Village instead. Use the ball of wool on the unfinished lyre, which will require 25 Fletching.\n\n[[File:The Fremennik Trials - Playing the Lyre.png|thumb|A player performs with their lyre.|209x209px]]\n\nOnce you've obtained the lyre, you need to get it enchanted. Bring a [[raw shark]], [[manta ray]], or [[sea turtle]] with you (if you have more than one lyre to enchant, then bring '''one fish for each lyre''' you wish to have enchanted; if using raw sharks, try to get raw sharks from Rufus' Meat Emporium in Canifis over a period of time). Southwest of Rellekka is a strange altar. With the lyre in your inventory, use your raw shark/manta ray/sea turtle on the strange altar. A spirit named Fossegrimen will appear and enchant your lyre for you.\n\nGo back, and talk to Olaf the Bard again. Then, enter the door the Longhall Bouncer is guarding to go onstage. Play your lyre in front of the crowd, then talk to Olaf a final time to get his vote.\n\n<div align=\"right\">[[#Walkthrough|(Return to Trials Map)]]</div>\n\n===Sigli the Huntsman===\n[[File:Sigli the Huntsman chathead.png|left]]\n'''''Items needed:''' None but recommended to bring some [[food]], [[armour]], a [[weapon]] (a Halberd is best, ranged is not effective), and [[prayer potion]]s.''\n[[File:The Fremennik Trials - Fighting the Draugen.png|thumb|250px|A player fights the Draugen.]]\nSigli can be found near the entrance gate.\nYour task is to find the [[Draugen]], an immortal spirit, and defeat it to weaken it. Keep using the [[hunters' talisman]] that he gives you to find where to go. The talisman is used the same way you might use a [[Runecrafting]] [[talisman]]; selecting locate gives a chat message in the direction to go. The Draugen moves around the [[Fremennik Province]] and can cross bridges. There is a small, transparent looking butterfly that follows the Draugen.  It can be used to help located him. Level 48 [[Agility]] can help by allowing you access to the shortcut log bridge, as the Draugen has a random location that changes frequently. It should be noted, that if a player wants to find the [[Draugen]] easily and fast, the player can sit near the bridge to the east of the strange altar and camp in a spot. Eventually, the Draugen will appear, announced by a chat message, \"The Draugen is here! Beware!\" With the proper [[equipment|gear]], a level-50 player should defeat him without problems. However, it should be noted that the Draugen is particularly resistant to ranged attacks. When you defeat him, the Draugen's essence will be absorbed into the hunters' talisman. Return with the talisman to [[Sigli the Huntsman|Sigli]] to get his vote. \n\n<div align=\"right\">[[#Walkthrough|(Return to Trials Map)]]</div>\n\n===Sigmund the Merchant===\n'''''Items needed:''' 5,000 [[coins]]''\n[[File:Sigmund The Merchant chathead.png|left]]\nYou can find [[Sigmund the Merchant (Shop)|Sigmund]] in the market. He will want you to get him an [[exotic flower]].

Every time he is defeated, he regains his health back and becomes much stronger. '''You only need to defeat Koschei for the first 3 rounds; if you die to him on the 4th round, you will pass Thorvald's trial.'''\n#You cannot use any [[weapons]] or [[armour]] or bring [[runes]]. However, you can use [[food]], [[Prayer]], any amulet, bracelet, [[god book]]s and [[rings of recoil]].\n#NOTE: [[Combat bracelet]] and [[Amulet of glory]] are allowed.\n#NOTE: It is possible to flinch Koschei but not recommended due to the fact if you take too long to kill he will despawn and you will have to restart.\n\nIt is possible to glitch the fight if you die, and you come back quick enough it is possible to keep fighting him from the point at which you died, and ignore the second Thorvald that pops up.\n\nStock up on the food and potions, then proceed to head down to Thorvald's basement. Note that if you have completed the [[Lost City]] quest, you can smuggle a [[dramen staff]] into the arena by taking a [[dramen branch]], and a [[knife]] into the arena with you. When you enter the arena, Koschei is hidden. Simply roam around for a short while, and he will appear.\n[[File:Koschei Final.png|thumb|Koschei's final form.]]\nKoschei's first form is easy and should give you no problems. After you defeat him, he will regain all of his health and become stronger. There is no way to safe-spot him as you have no weapons, but you can trap him over the hole and wait a while for your health to regenerate. However, if you stay there too long, he'll disappear and reappear after you run around, back in his first form. His level is not displayed.\n\nHis second form might give you a bit of trouble, and you might need to use food or Prayer. [[Combat pure|Pures]] can't really beat this form unless they are [[Melee]] pures.\n\nHis third form is fairly difficult, so you'll most likely need to use food and/or Prayer here. You may need a [[prayer potion]] here as it is possible to run out of prayer points early. This is the last form required for you to defeat to complete the quest.\n[[File:Koschei Defeats Player.png|thumb|left|190px|The player is defeated by Koschei.]]\n'''<span style=\"color: red\">Warning</span>: DO NOT LEAVE AFTER THE 3ED FIGHT. EITHER WIN THE 4TH FIGHT OR LET HIM WIN! (Leaving the arena during the 4th fight will result in your progress being reset, but his fourth form may roam the area when you return).'''\n\n'''Note''': If wearing a [[Ring of Life]], it is now safe to remove as you '''cannot''' die fighting his fourth form, you will be left at 1 hitpoint instead.\n\nThe fourth form is the hardest. He will hit about once every quarter second, but he usually hits one. It is recommended that the player use a [[Ring of recoil]], but be sure to bring enough rings for the fight (7 minimum) as the ring breaks after 40 hitpoints of damage, and Koschei has 255 HP in this form. In this form, Koschei will quickly drop your prayer points in intervals of 1-2 every second and will drop all of your prayer points as soon as the form starts.\n\nKoschei will also attack extremely quickly, but will only have a max hit of 1. If you manage to beat Koschei in this form, you will be given a [[Fremennik blade]] (which you can find elsewhere). Otherwise, when Koschei leaves you at 1 hitpoint, you will kneel on the ground and find yourself upstairs. Regardless, Thorvald will give you his vote for your bravery in fighting a superior foe.\n\n<div align=\"right\">[[#Walkthrough|(Return to Trials Map)]]</div>\n\n===Peer the Seer===\n[[File:Peer the Seer chathead.png|left]]\n[[Peer the Seer|Peer]] is found south of the market. He'll give you his vote if you can simply enter the front door to his house, and then come out the other side.

The first quest, The Giant Dwarf, introduces the city and the powerful business Consortium that rules the dwarven realm.

Go to the dungeon east of Rellekka, which is also located south of [[Olaf Hradson|Olaf]]. The fairy ring code {{Fairycode|dks}} also drops you off very close to this dungeon entrance.\n\nUpon entering, head into the crack in the wall; don't go south, as that takes you to the base of [[Trollweiss Mountain]].\n\nWhen you enter, speak to the [[Dwarven Boatman]] and ask him to take you to Keldagrim. A cutscene will ensue where he tells you about Keldagrim's rich history, before the \"boat\" malfunctions and crashes into the statue of King Alvis. Upon arriving at Keldagrim, you are arrested by two [[Black Guard Berserker]]s, and taken to the Black Guard headquarters.\n\nCommander Veldaban will say that your arrest was for nothing but to talk with him, and asks you to replace the statue. Talk to [[Blasidar the sculptor]]. He lives in the eastern side of Keldagrim, across the bridge, south of the kebab shop/north of the bar. He will make the statue if you can get him clothes, an axe and boots fit for a king. These three sections may be done in any order.\n\n:'''Note:''' Throughout the quest, the drop trick cannot be used to obtain multiple quest items; however, this can be bypassed for every item except the boots by using [[Telekinetic Grab]]. \n\n===Clothes fit for a king===\n'''''Items required:''' 200 [[coins]], [[coal]], [[logs]] and a [[tinderbox]].''\n[[File:Vermundi location.png|thumb|Vermundi's Location]]\n[[File:Librarian location.png|thumb|The librarian's location]]\nTalk to [[Vermundi]] who is in the southern corner of the east marketplace (indicated by the silk symbol) and ask her about making the king's clothes. She can, but first she needs a picture of the clothes. Talk to the [[librarian]] in the house in the northeastern corner of west [[Keldagrim]] and he will tell you to search the library for a book about dwarven clothes. Climb any bookcase with a ladder in front of it to find the [[book on costumes]]. \n\n'''Note:''' You must speak with the librarian before you are able to find the book. If you weigh 30&nbsp;kg or more, you will be unable to climb the ladder. You can deposit your items in the nearby [[bank]] to reduce your weight, or simply drop them on the ground then climb the bookcase and pick items back up after.\n\nGive Vermundi the book. You now need to fix her steam-powered spinning machine. Buy a [[tinderbox]] from the [[general store]] on the west side of town if you need one. Then, mine one piece of [[coal]] on the east side if you need one. Use the coal on her machine with [[logs]] in your inventory. Now light it with your tinderbox (you will need 16 firemaking for this part, else it will never ignite), and then talk to her again and pay her 200 [[coins]] to get the [[exquisite clothes]]. If you fail to light the machine, just use your tinderbox on it again. If you do not yet have three sapphires, there are some available for purchase at the gem stall north of Vermundi.\n\n===An axe fit for a king===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[redberry pie]] (if you haven't completed [[The Knight's Sword]]), an [[iron bar]], 3 [[sapphire]]s''\n[[File:Santiri location.png|thumb|Santiri's location]]\n[[File:Thurgo location.png|thumb|Thurgo's location]]\nTalk to [[Santiri]], who is in the sword shop all the way in the northwest of west [[Keldagrim]]. He talks about how his family came to possess the Battleaxe, and then mentions that it has been damaged and that the [[sapphire]]s on the hilt had either been stolen or washed away. During the dialogue where you offer to repair the axe Santiri may note your mastery of [[smithing]] but exclaims that even you aren't skilled enough.\n\nUse three sapphires on it to rebuild the hilt. He then says that the blade itself is not up to scratch anyway, but that only an [[Imcando dwarf]] could repair it. Santiri will then refer you to the librarian, just east of his shop, who you ask about finding an Imcando dwarf.\n\nIf you have completed [[The Knight's Sword]], your character will mention that they know an Imcando dwarf and you can disregard the next part and just go find [[Thurgo]]. However, if you have not yet reached the part where you learn about the Imcando, then go to the librarians in Keldagrim about Imcando. Next, go to [[Reldo]] in the [[Varrock Palace]] library and he will teach you about them.\n\nIn order to get to [[Varrock]], you can use a cart in the eastern part of Keldagrim to ride to the [[Grand Exchange]], other than using a [[Varrock teleport]] or walking there. In addition, you can also use a charged Amulet of Glory in order to teleport to Draynor Village. If you have access to the [[fairy rings|fairy ring system]], the code to [[Mudskipper Point]] is {{Fairycode|AIQ}}.\n\nGo to Thurgo with an [[iron bar]] (and a [[redberry pie]] if you haven't completed [[The Knight's Sword]]), and ask him to repair the axe. He is in the house with an [[anvil]] symbol in Mudskipper Point, southeast of [[Rimmington]] and south of [[Port Sarim]]. If you give him the pie before asking if he's an Imcando, you will need another pie in your inventory to unlock the conversation tree but you do not need to give it to him. Do not attempt the drop trick with the completed axe once Thurgo has repaired it. Thurgo will supply you with another (iron bar) repaired axe if you drop the one in your inventory, but it is ungemmed and you will need to repair it with another three sapphires. You will be unable to pick up the axe you have dropped.\n\nWhen Thurgo is finished with the axe, you have the option to return immediately to Keldagrim. Once you return to Keldagrim, use the axe on Riki the sculptor's model to give it to him. He will take the axe along with the clothing.\n\n===Boots fit for a king===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[law rune|law]] and [[air rune]].''\n\nGo to the southwestern [[anvil]] on the west side of [[Keldagrim]] (south of the Black Guards' HQ) and ask [[Saro]] about the boots. He sold them to [[Dromund]], another dwarf in Keldagrim. Speak to Dromund\u00a0in his house just north of the bank. He refuses to sell you the boots, so you will have to steal them from him.\n\nWhen Dromund is not looking towards you, steal the [[left boot]] from the table next to the door. The [[right boot]] is on another table, but you can't steal it even when his back is turned because of his [[Dromund's cat|cat]] watching over it. In order to steal the right boot, you need to go outside, stand in the window where the right boot is in plain view, then use [[Telekinetic Grab]] on it, as Dromund will not permit anyone to use magic inside the house. Like the left boot, you'll have to wait for Dromund to have his back turned first.\n\nOnce both boots are obtained, they turn into [[Exquisite boots]].\n\n:'''Give your boots to [[Riki the sculptor's model|Riki]] and speak with him afterwards <u>before</u> you try to join any Consortium.'''\n:'''Speak to [[Blasidar the sculptor|Blasidar]] before starting the tasks below or the tasks for the director will go on indefinitely!'''\n\n===Joining the consortium===\nThere are eight mining companies in the [[Consortium]], which are located upstairs in either the east or west marketplace. You will need to join one of them, and this choice will not have any significant impact on the quest. '''Note: if you have purchased and banked all the ores and bars, then choose a Consortium in the west marketplace, as the Bank is on the west side, this will save time and stamina potions.'''.\n\nThe companies are:\n*The Blue Opal\n*The Brown Engine ''(female players are not allowed to join this company)''\n*The Green Gemstone\n*The Purple Pewter\n*The Red Axe ''(you cannot join this company)''\n*The Silver Cog\n*The White Chisel\n*The Yellow Fortune ''(male players are not allowed to join this company)''\n\nTalk to the secretary of the company that you want to work for. You will be given a task to collect a certain kind of ore within a time limit. You must complete several errands for the Secretary. All of the ores can be found nearby but cannot be returned in noted form. It is recommended to buy 5-10 of each ore (can exclude the expensive ones) before beginning, and then simply talk to the secretary with 4/5 of each of your ores on you, allowing you to immediately finish tasks. '''If you don't like the proposed task, just simply start the conversation with the Secretary over.'''\n:'''Note:''' There is an alternative for all the ores except [[clay]]; they may be purchased downstairs in the [[Blast Furnace]] from [[Ordan]].\n'''WARNING'''!: do not hop worlds / Log out while doing the task, all your progress will be lost.\n*[[Clay]] - Mine it in [[Rellekka]] if you've completed [[The Fremennik Trials]].\n*[[Copper ore|Copper]] - If you sail out of [[Keldagrim]] by talking to the [[Dwarven Boatman]], you can mine it directly east in the dwarven caves.\n*[[Tin ore|Tin]] - If you sail out of Keldagrim by talking to the boatman, you can mine it in the dwarven caves. Use the ferry.\n*[[Iron ore|Iron]] - Outside the entrance to the caves, you can mine iron in [[Fremennik Province]].\n*[[Silver ore|Silver]] - Mine it in Rellekka or steal it from the [[Silver Cog Silver Stall|silver stall]] in Keldagrim.\n*[[Coal]] - There is a mine in the northeastern part of Keldagrim.\n*[[Gold ore|Gold]] - There is a single gold vein in the dwarven caves in the southern mine shaft.\n*[[Mithril ore|Mithril]] - There are two rocks located in the mining area east of Rellekka, or go to the Grand Exchange. You can use the mine carts southeast of the consortium to do this now that you have started the quest.\n\nYou can ask the secretary for a new task if you cannot do the one you have been given. If you fail a task, you may need to log out in order to receive a new task. A great method of efficiently doing the errands is not to choose the option 'I'll take it', unless you like the proposed task or have the ores/bars needed in your inventory. By talking to the Secretary you can find out what he/she wants. You can keep doing this to get the tasks that you prefer. Another way to do this is to buy 10-15 of each ore from the [[Grand Exchange]], then simply take out the ores that are needed for each task from the bank or take the mine cart directly to the Grand Exchange and take the ores from the bank there. The mine cart trip is free of charge.\n\nAfter you have done several tasks you should notice that the Secretary's dialogue will become more friendly towards you. Ask to speak to the Director, and if you've done enough tasks, they will say \"Certainly, the Director is right over there.\" At this point you may start the Director's tasks. Tasks for the Director function in the same way as those for the secretary, but require bars instead of ores (2-5 bars per task). '''Make sure you have spoken to Blasidar before you start the director's tasks. If you do not talk to Blasidar, you will be able to complete tasks indefinitely, but never be offered to join their company.''' Since you should already have the bars in your bank, simply run to the Keldagrim bank and grab them. If not, you can use the minecarts at the East and travel to the Grand Exchange. \n\nDo tasks for the Director until they ask you whether you're considered joining their company, or until the Director states that you don't need to be doing running errands for them anymore. If you're lucky, you may only have to deliver one set of bars to the Director. If you refuse too many tasks, you'll have to start over with their secretary. '''Note that clicking out of the dialogue will have the same effect as refusing a task.'''\n\n===Art by committee===\n[[File:Consortium Meeting.png|thumb|left|Hreidmar storms out of the Consortium meeting.]]\n[[File:The Giant Dwarf statue.png|thumb|The completed statue.]]\nAsk to join the company. Then, tell the Director that [[Blasidar the sculptor|Blasidar]] sent you and after a short conversation tell them you will volunteer to support them at the next Consortium meeting (you must talk to him again even after he accepts you into the guild, you must say Blasidar sent you and say long live the clan). Return to [[Commander Veldaban]] (west of the bank) to go to the meeting and support your chosen director. '''Note that the meeting is 4 minutes long'''. You can '''skip the cutscene''' by refusing to go to the meeting; players who wish to view a summary of it can read the [[meeting notes]] received after completing the quest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Giant Dwarf\n|image = [[File:The Giant Dwarf reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*{{Skill clickpic|Mining|2,500}} [[Mining]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Smithing|2,500}} [[Smithing]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Crafting|2,500}} [[Crafting]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Magic|1,500}} [[Magic]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Thieving|1,500}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Firemaking|1,500}} [[Firemaking]] experience\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nThe completion of The Giant Dwarf is required for the following:\n*[[Another Slice of H.A.M.]]\n*[[Forgettable Tale...|Forgettable Tale of a Drunken Dwarf]]\n*The \"MAJOR LAVAS BADS AIR\" anagram during an elite clue.\n\n==Trivia==\n*There was a graphical glitch that appeared during the cutscenes that shows a closeup up the Giant Dwarf statue: the body appeared to be floating above the legs, and the head (once it had been added) was floating above the body.\n*When you are getting the Dwarven battleaxe repaired by Thurgo, the player mentions Keldagrim- to which he responds \"Ah, Keldagrim.

He will ask what the translation is in three lines, so pick each line from the choices offered. If none of the options match, select the ''\"None of the above\"'' option until the correct option presents itself. For the first line, you have to go to the third set of choices offered. He will explain that someone used his seal to have [[Hazelmere]] give away [[Daconia rock]]s, which were made as a \"fail-safe\" and can kill the tree. He will direct you to talk to [[Glough]], his head tree guardian. Glough is located south of the [[Grand Tree]], east of the ramp, in a tree house. He will tell you that he will take care of the problem.\n\n===Investigation===\n'''''Items required:''' 1000 [[coins]] (if you haven't helped [[Femi]]), [[teleport]] out of [[Karamja]] (optional but recommended).''\n\nReturn to [[King Narnode Shareen]], and he will tell you that [[Glough]] has caught and imprisoned a human, who was found carrying the [[Daconia rock]]s.

He tells you to search Glough's house for evidence. Go to Glough's house. Search the cupboard, and you will find his journal. Talk to Glough, who then orders the guards at you. After the conversation, you will be put in the cell next to Charlie's. Talk to Charlie, he will tell you about the [[Ship Yard]] on [[Karamja]], and give you the password to access it, which is '''Ka-Lu-Min'''.\n\n[[King Shareen|The king]] will appear and apologise for Glough imprisoning you. He will tell you that guards are watching the entrances, and tells you to quickly escape on the [[Gnome glider]] on the top floor of the [[Grand Tree]], next to the cells. Talk to the pilot, and he will fly you to the Ship Yard.\n\n===Karamja===\nThe glider will crash just west of the Ship Yard. Run east past the level 53 [[jogre]]s, which will likely attack you on sight directly after landing ''(be wary of this if you're a low level)''. When you reach the Ship Yard and try to open the gate, a [[Shipyard worker]] will stop you. Tell him that Glough sent you, and now, you need to tell him the password Charlie gave you, '''Ka-Lu-Min'''. After telling the Shipyard worker the password, he'll let you in.\n\nGo out to the southern docks and you'll find the [[foreman]]. Once you find the foreman, you can either kill him (he is level 23), or you can talk to him, saying Glough sent you. He will take you to his quarters, and you need to answer some questions to prove you are sent by Glough, as he despises humans. He will ask how Glough's wife is, the correct answer is \"'''Sadly his wife is no longer with us'''\". He will also ask what Glough's favourite food is, answer is \"'''Worm holes'''\". Finally, he asks what his new girlfriend's name is, which is \"'''Anita'''\".\n\nAfter killing him or answering the questions, you will receive a [[lumber order]] and find out Glough is using the tree to get lumber for battleships. Take it to [[King Shareen|the king]]. The main entrance to the stronghold is blocked, however (and the glider is broken), so you will need to find a way through. If you have completed the [[Tree Gnome Village]] quest, you can use the [[Spirit tree]] in the village. If you haven't completed Tree Gnome Village, you need to go to the [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]] gate and talk to [[Femi]]. Tell her you need to get inside, and she will sneak you in. If you haven't helped her previously, she will charge you 1,000 coins. If you have, she will help you for free.\n:'''Note:''' If you've never used the Stronghold entrance before (i.e. you've always gotten in via the Spirit trees), Femi will say that you helped her and let you in free.\n\n===Tuzo===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Lumber order]].''\n\nAfter you show [[King Shareen|the king]] the [[Lumber order|note]] from the [[foreman]], he still will not believe your accusations, call you as paranoid as [[Glough]], and ask you to leave for your own safety.\n[[File:Anita's house location.png|thumb|200px|Anita's house on the map]]\nSpeak to [[Charlie]] again on the top floor of the [[Grand Tree]]. He will suggest you speak to [[Anita]], Glough's girlfriend. Go and talk to her. She is near the swamp to the north-west of the [[Grand Tree]]\u00a0in the northwesternmost house; you have to go upstairs. She will give you a [[Glough's key|key]] and ask you to return it to Glough.\n[[File:The Grand Tree - Opening the Chest.png|thumb|left|220px|Opening the chest for the notes.]]\nGo to Glough's house, and use the key to open the chest. Inside, you will find some of his [[Invasion plans|notes]] detailing his plan to seize control of ''RuneScape''. Click \"Continue\" otherwise you won't get the notes. Take the notes to King Shareen. He will still not believe your evidence. He will tell you that in their search of Glough's house all they found were four bundles of [[twigs]]. They spell out the word ''TUZO''. Using the [[Translation book]], this translates to \"open.\" The King will give you all four bundles of twigs.\n:'''Note:''' You must have at least 4 free inventory spaces in order to receive the twigs!\n[[File:The Grand Tree - Using the Twigs.png|thumb|220px|Using the twigs on the pillars.]]\nReturn to Glough's house, and climb up the watchtower. This tree is located on the east side of the {{FloorNumber|2}} and requires 25 [[Agility]] to climb. Up in the watchtower, you will find a stone stand and four pillars. Use the twigs with the four pillars to spell out ''TUZO'', starting from the far left. After you have placed the twigs on the four pillars, you will hear gears turning. You can now open the trap door on this platform, but do not go in yet unless you are prepared for the fight.\n\n===Encountering the black demon===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Combat]] [[equipment]] and [[food]] to last in a fight against a level 172 [[Black demon]].''\n\nAfter you enter, [[Glough]] will come talk to you, threatening you with his plans to wipe out humans. After he's done, a level 172 [[Black demon]] will appear and attack you.\nPlayers can either fight the demon using [[Melee]], or hide in a [[safe spot]] and use [[Ranged]], [[Magic]] or a [[halberd]].\n[[File:The Grand Tree - Boss Fight Safespot.png|thumb|240px|The safe spot to use Ranged or Magic where Glough stands.]]\nIf you choose to use ranged or magical attacks, then safe-spot where Glough is placed during the fight. If he can still attack you, then move behind another rock until he can no longer attack you. You can also go into the tunnel to where the demon cannot reach, so you can attack him using ranged or magical attacks.\n\n:'''Note:''' If you don't kill the demon within 8-9 minutes, it will '''disappear''' and you'll have to start the battle '''all over again'''. Should this happen, walk along the tunnel and head up the ladder next to the [[King Narnode Shareen|king]], and re-enter Glough's trapdoor.\n\n===The adamant king===\nAfter defeating the demon, walk along the passage until you find [[King Shareen]] standing by a ladder. Talk to him and tell him that Glough had sent a demon to attack you, but he will not believe you. He finally sends a guard to scout for Glough, to which the guard comes back with Glough, who was hiding amongst the stones. The king apologises, and asks you to locate the last [[daconia rock]].\n\nSearch the roots all around the area until you find the daconia rock. Though it can be time-consuming, you might need to search all of the roots. If you somehow lose the rock, it'll spawn in the root where you first found it.\n\nWhen the dialogue pops up stating that you found the stone, click continue or it won't appear in your inventory. After obtaining the rock, talk to King Shareen again for your reward for saving the Grand Tree.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Grand Tree\n|image = [[File:The Grand Tree reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 5\n|rewards = *18,400 [[Attack]] experience\n*7,900 [[Agility]] experience\n*2,150 [[Magic]] experience\n*Access to the [[Grand Tree mine|mine]] under the [[Grand Tree]].\n*Access to the [[Gnome glider]] transportation system.\n*Ability to use the [[Agility shortcut]] from the Grand Tree to the [[Barbarian Outpost]] (with 37 [[Agility]]).\n*Ability to use the Spirit tree in the Stronghold after the completion of [[Tree Gnome Village]].\n}}\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of The Grand Tree is required for the following:\n*[[The Eyes of Glouphrie]]\n*[[Monkey Madness I]]\n\n{{The Grand Tree}}"], "The Great Brain Robbery": ["{{External|rs}}\n{{Has quick guide}}{{Infobox Quest\n|name = The Great Brain Robbery\n|image = [[File:The Great Brain Robbery.png|300px]]\n|number = 122\n|members = Yes\n|release = 6 March [[2007]]\n|update = Great Brain Robbery\n|series = [[List of quest series#Pirate series|Pirate]]\n|difficulty = Experienced\n|developer = Anthony W\n}}\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|description= The peaceful contemplation of the monks of [[Harmony Island]] has been disturbed by such rude interruptions as an invasion of zombie pirates and the theft of their brains!

Agree to sail with Bill to [[Mos Le'Harmless]]. You may opt to use the [[Mos le'harmless teleport]] scroll, or to use the [[Trouble Brewing]] [[minigame teleport]]. Near the dock, you will notice a rather sickly-looking monk named [[Brother Tranquility]]. Talk to him to begin the quest\u2014select the option regarding undead pirates. He will explain how some of his fellow monks are in trouble and asks for help. Accept the offer to be teleported to\u00a0[[Harmony Island]].\n\n===Gathering info===\n[[File:Moving Saradomin statue.png|right|thumb|121px|Moving the statue.]]Make sure you have the supplies listed earlier and head outside the windmill. [[Zombie pirate]]s (level 57) are [[aggressive]] and will attack. A short way to the north will be a [[Saradomin]] statue that can be pulled. Pull the statue. Go down the hole and into a tunnel. It is full of water, so equip the diving gear to submerge beneath the water. Note that you cannot enter the water if you are carrying a follower such as a pet cat. Run past the zombie pirates and repair the stairs at the far end of the tunnel (you can be attacked while repairing the stairs and it takes a while). Go up them, climb up the ladder in the next room; then, look through the peephole to spy on the enemy.\n\n[[File:Peeking through hole.png|thumb|left|The secret room, peek through the hole.]]\n\n===The prayer book===\nReport back to [[Brother Tranquility]]. He will suggest getting a book that can be used to pray away [[poison]]. Travel to the [[Monastery]] near [[Edgeville]] to find the [[prayer book]] in a bookshelf towards the south-west corner of the building on the ground floor. Read the book, which provides instructions on how to use it. Equip a [[holy symbol]] and return to [[Harmony Island]].\u00a0The zombies have begun to gas the windmill, so right-click the book and select \"recite-prayer.\" After this, make sure to talk to Brother Tranquility.\n\n===The doctor===\n'''''Item(s) required:''' [[Ring of charos]]''\n\n''Optional item(s): [[Ectophial]], [[armour]], [[food]], [[weapon]] and/or [[Wolfbane dagger]].''\n[[File:Great Brain Robbery Elfinlocks.png|210px|thumb|Elfinlocks makes another cameo appearance.]]\nNow that the monks are no longer in danger of being [[poisoned]], they would like to get their brains back in their bodies where they belong. Travel to [[Dr. Fenkenstrain]]\u00a0in [[Fenkenstrain's Castle|his castle]]\u00a0and climb up to the jail where [[Lord Rologarth]]\u00a0(Fenkenstrain's monster) was first held. After a bit of negotiation, he agrees that a new home free of the threat of being eaten sounds better than where he is. However, he does not want to risk being eaten while travelling. He is also allergic to teleportation, so another way needs to be found.\n\nHead to [[Canifis]] and talk to [[Rufus]], the owner of the meat store north of the bank. Make sure to be wearing the [[ring of charos]]\u00a0while talking to him. Rufus will give you some [[crate part]]s and a [[wolf whistle]]. You need to build ten decoy cats to fill the crate\u00a0since Rufus assumes the crate will be transporting cats.\n\n'''''Tip:''' Since you are right next to a bank, deposit the whistle and crate parts and take out Mos Le'Harmless teleport (treasure trail), 10 wooden [[plank]]s, 10 pieces of [[fur]], and a [[hammer]] \u2014 [[home teleport]] runes or tab and an [[ectophial]] are advised for easy travelling. If you do not have a Clockmaker's bench yet, you will also need to bring 4 [[oak plank]]s and a [[saw]]. Also, if you still need fur, you can kill [[Canifis villager]]s\u2014they'll transform into level 88 [[werewolves]] if you don't use [[Wolfbane]], so be careful. You can also obtain fur by thieving from stalls in Ardougne (or trading the fur trader there) or by purchasing fur in Varrock square for 20 coins apiece. Ultimate ironmen may find a table in the south-east tower of Fenkenstrain's castle on the first floor helpful.''\n[[File:Tricking Rufus.png|thumb|210px|Tricking Rufus into giving you the shipping order.]]\n[[File:Great Brain Robbery crate.png|thumb|left|230px|Building the delivery crate.]] Travel to a [[Player-owned house]]\u00a0that has a Clockmaker's bench. Craft the materials into 10\u00a0[[wooden cat]]s. Grab your ring of charos, the 10 wooden cats, 4 planks (normal), a hammer, ~50 [[nails]], the crate parts, and the wolf whistle before travelling back to Fenkenstrain's castle. When you get to the room where the doctor is hiding, you'll see a hotspot to build the crate. Do so, and then, use the extra (normal) planks of wood to build a false bottom by clicking on the crate again and selecting \"add-bottom.\" Fill it with the fake cats and\u00a0then use the wolf whistle\u00a0Rufus gave you to call him. Fenkenstrain will automatically get in the crate. Once past inspection, Rufus will give you a [[shipping order]]. Use this on the crate, and it will be ''teleported'' to the island.\n\n===Making the transplants===\nNow that the doctor is on the island, travel back to [[Mos Le'Harmless]]. Use the island bank to grab a [[hammer]], diving gear, [[armour]], and a [[weapon]] before teleporting to [[Harmony Island]]. [[Dr. Fenkenstrain]] is in the basement and needs some equipment to perform the surgery. He will give you a list of items to collect:\n*[[Brain tongs]]\n*[[Cranial clamp]]\n*3 [[bell jar]]s\n*30 [[skull staple]]s\n*A [[hammer]]\n\nLuckily, the bad guys already have what you need since they performed the surgery in the first place. The only problem is how to get inside the building...[[File:Blowing up the door.gif|frame|left|The player creates an explosion to open the door.]]\nPut on the diving suit to avoid passing out from the gas, and head north from the windmill to the ship beached nearby. Search the locker on the ground floor to get a [[Fuse (The Great Brain Robbery)|fuse]]; then, climb up a level and get a [[tinderbox]] and a [[keg]] of powder. With these in hand, go back to the front door of the monastery. Wedge the keg in the front door, add a fuse, and then, light it. The door is now open.\n\n[[File:Great Brain Robbery cat cutscene.png|thumb|right|250px|The gruesome operation, replaced with a cute cat playing with a ball.]]\nOnce inside, kill the 4\u00a0[[Sorebones]]\u00a0to obtain all\u00a0the needed equipment. You must pick up the dropped items after each kill, or else you will just get duplicates. Walk back to the windmill, head downstairs, and give all this to Dr. Fenkenstrain to begin the gruesome surgery. A cutscene of a cute cat playing with a ball will ensue due to the surgery being too gruesome. Make sure to speak to [[Brother Tranquility]] after the operation.\n\n===The big battle===\n[[File:Barrelchest.png|right|thumb|200px|The Barrelchest!]]'''<span style=\"color:red\">Warning:</span> If you die, you will not be able to retrieve your items.'''\nReturn to the bank on [[Mos Le'Harmless]] and grab all the [[armour]], [[food]], and [[potions]] you will need for the fight. '''<span style=\"color:red\">Warning:</span>\u00a0You still need to wear your diving suit.'''\n\nWhen you enter the monastery, only [[Mi-Gor]] will be there, giving you the option to confront him. When you do, he will summon his monstrosity, a giant mess of machinery named [[Barrelchest]],\u00a0to attack you.\n\n[[File:Barrelchest safespot.png|thumb|250px|Safespotting the barrelchest.]]\n[[Prayer]] (and also Defence) drains faster than usual during the fight, and Barrelchest will turn your Prayers off, but just keep turning it back on ('''''note''': repeatedly turning it on can be a huge time waste and result in death if he gets lucky with the timing of his hits, plan to do this without prayer to avoid that)''. Bringing several [[prayer potion]]s and at least ten good food is highly recommended. Barrelchest is a fairly blunt instrument; he will not use anything but [[Melee]] attacks, which are fairly inaccurate; however, when he does hit, they are almost always 20's. It is possible to catch him on the side of a pew and attack him from a distance without any sort of retaliation by standing behind benches for [[safespot]]ting. This makes [[ranging]] or [[maging]] an incredibly effective way to take out Barrelchest. However, do not hide behind a pew when attempting to do this. Catch him on the corner of the first pew by taking a few steps back when you first start the battle, or he will strike the ground with his anchor and cause 25 damage. ''Alternatively... ''just teleport out when you encounter him and make your way back to the boss room but don't move anywhere; the spot you will be standing in serves as a safespot.\n\nOnce you have killed Barrelchest, pick up his [[Barrelchest anchor|anchor]] and walk back to the windmill to inform [[Brother Tranquility]] of your victory. \n\nHe will thank you and give you a lamp granting 5,000 experience in the skill of your choice.\n[[File:Barrelchest dies.gif|centre|frame|The Barrelchest is defeated!]]\n\n'''Congratulations! Quest complete!'''\n\n''Tip: If you died during the boss fight, remember to pickpocket Dr. Fenkenstrain to receive another ring of charos.''\n\n''Tip: If your inventory was full when talking to [[Brother Tranquility]] after the boss fight, you can still claim the experience lamp by talking to him again with at least one free inventory space.''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Great Brain Robbery\n|image = [[File:The Great Brain Robbery reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*{{Skill clickpic|Prayer|6,000}}[[Prayer]] experience \n*{{Skill clickpic|Crafting|3,000}}[[Crafting]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Construction|2,000}}[[Construction]] experience\n*[[Blessed lamp]] ({{Skill clickpic|total|5,000}} experience in a chosen skill above level 30 and can be placed in your bank)\n*[[Barrelchest anchor]] (To repair your barrelchest anchor, return to [[Mos Le'Harmless]] and make sure you have a [[book o' piracy]] in your inventory; then, go to the docks south of the bank and talk to \"[[Smith]].\" He can fix your anchor for 230,000 gold coins.)\n*[[Prayer book]]\n}}\n\n==Music==\n* [[Zombiism]]\n\n==Tips==\n* Having the [[Book o' piracy]] allows you to skip the first speech with [[Bill Teach]] in getting him to transport you to [[Mos Le'Harmless]].\n* You don't need to fully complete the quest to receive and use the [[barrelchest anchor]]\u2014you just need to kill [[Barrelchest]].\n* A [[Kharyrll Teleport]] ([[Canifis]] teleport) in your [[house]] provides faster return to [[Fenkenstrain's Castle|Fenkenstrain's house]] after creating the fake cats.\n* The [[Charter ship]]s are a useful (if pricey) way to get to Mos Le'Harmless and [[Port Khazard]].\n* Talk to the pirate at the docks of Mos Le'Harmless to convert the anchor to a two-handed weapon for a fee of 230,000 coins (see above, under reward).\n* [[Barrelchest]] is a large enemy, which allows for the [[dragon halberd]] [[special attack]] to be useful, although you cannot safespot with a halberd because of Barrelchest's wide attacks.\n* The \"[[blessed lamp]]\" is a bankable.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The Great Brain Robbery is a reference to the 1903 movie ''{{Wp|The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery}}''.\n** The music track [[Zombiism]] when on Harmony Island comes from the same movie.\n* Another [[Wikipedia:Monty Pyton's Flying Circus|Monty Python]] reference is hidden in the quest. When [[Rufus]] comments that the cats aren't moving, the character will comment that they're \"probably pining\", referring to \"[[Wikipedia:Dead Parrot|The Dead Parrot Sketch]]\".\n* The [[Mi-Gor]] character and [[Barrelchest]] monster are probably references to [[Wikipedia:emphysema|emphysema]], a fatal lung disease that leaves victims with a \"barrelchest\" and a scary voice.\n* This quest marks the second appearance of [[Elfinlocks]], a fake player from the [[Draynor bank robbery]] plot, who is travelling with her clockwork cat in [[Canifis]]. She appears to have gained another [[blue partyhat]] since her last appearance.\n* After the player builds the crate and fills it with the wooden cats, the player says \"Urge to kill...rising!\" This is a reference to an episode of The Simpsons where Homer says the same line.\n* When first going to [[Harmony Island]], the player does the \"[[Scared]]\" emote saying that they're afraid of getting hit while transporting. This is a reference to the transportation method used in [[Rum Deal]].\n* The crate hotspot is the only known hotspot that is made outside of your [[Construction|house]].\n* If you are wearing the [[fishbowl helmet]] and you blow the whistle to call [[Rufus]], you'll get the following message \"''You should take your diving helmet off before you try to blow the whistle''.\"\n* If you get the Mysterious Old Man or Dr. Jekyll random events while you are underwater, they will also be wearing a fishbowl helmet.\n* When Dr Fenkenstrain tells you the list of equipment he needs, the player says mentions \"Unusual Implements R Us\". This is probably a reference to the American toy store \"Toys R Us\".\n* \"Not the box\" is probably a reference to the film Hook and the Boo Box\n* At the beginning of the quest while talking to Brother Tranquility, the player refers to Mos Le'Harmless as \"a hive of scum and villainy\". This is a reference to Ben Kenobi's line describing Mos Eisley in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.\n\n{{The Great Brain Robbery}}\n[[Category:Experienced quests]]"], "The Hand in the Sand": ["{{External|rs}}\n{{Has quick guide}}\n{{Infobox quest\n|name = The Hand in the Sand\n|number = 96\n|image = [[File:Magically refilled sandpit.png|300px]]\n|members = Yes\n|release = 10 January [[2006]]\n|update = The Hand in the Sand\n|series = None\n|difficulty = Intermediate\n|developer = Marion C\n}}\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Talk to [[Bert]] in [[Yanille]] near the [[sandpit]].\n|difficulty = 2\n|description = [[Bert]] the Sandman in Yanille is in a spot of bother.

He's afraid it will cause him some kind of trouble, and wants you to investigate it. He'll tell you to go talk to the [[Guard Captain|captain of the guards]]. He hangs around [[Dragon Inn|the inn]] in Yanille.\n\nTake the hand and a beer to the captain of the guards in the [[Ye Olde Dragon Inn]]. Give him the beer. He will ramble on, and then, he'll take a look at the hand and simply drop it in his beer, turning it into a [[beer soaked hand]]. \n\nGo to the [[Wizards' Guild]], just east of the bar, enter if you meet the requirements (66 [[Magic]]), or ring the bell to make [[Zavistic Rarve]] come out. Talk to him and explain the situation. He will tell you that this is the hand of one of his wizards, [[Clarence]]. He'll ask you to see if Bert's working schedule has changed recently.\n\n===Sandy the slavedriver===\n'''''Items needed:''' [[Bert's rota]]''\n[[File:Sandy sand co small.png|thumb|Sandy's whereabouts.]]\nReturn to [[Bert]]'s home, and talk to him again. He'll tell you that he works for [[Sandy Sand Co]], which is based in [[Brimhaven]]. He'll give you a copy of his [[Bert's rota|schedule]] and tell you that it hasn't changed recently, or so he thinks. Now, you need to head to [[Sandy]] in Brimhaven. You can go to [[Ardougne]] and pay 30 [[coins]] to get to Brimhaven. Sandy is located in the office just north-west of the [[Dead Man's Chest]] bar.\n[[File:Sandy chathead.png|left]]\nIn Brimhaven, you'll see Sandy in his office. You can talk to him first if you want, but this isn't necessary. Search his desk in the house to get Bert's old schedule. Read it and compare it to the other schedule to see that Bert has indeed been working longer hours. While you're here, [[pickpocket]] Sandy to find some [[sand]] in his pocket \u2014 this may take multiple attempts. Keep it; it will become important later on in the quest.\n\n===Truth serum===\n'''''Items Needed:''' [[Bert's rota]], [[Sandy's rota]], [[white berries]], [[redberries]], [[lantern lens]], [[sand]] (pickpocketed from [[Sandy]]), 2 empty [[vial]]s.''\n\nNow, you need to visit [[Bert]] once more. Talk to Bert in [[Yanille]] to find a [[A magic scroll (The Hand in the Sand)|magic scroll]] that appeared in his house recently. It appears normal, but do not throw it out.\n[[File:Zavistic Rarve chathead.png|left]]\nTake the scroll to [[Zavistic Rarve]] at the Wizards Guild to learn that it's a mind-altering scroll, and it was a trick to change Bert's hours without having to pay him more money. Now that you know that [[Sandy]] is behind it, you need to first get [[Betty]] in [[Port Sarim]] to make you a [[truth serum]], and then record Sandy using the [[magical orb]] he gave you.\n\nTake two vials, the redberries, the white berries, and a lantern lens, as well as the sand pickpocketed from Sandy's pocket with you to Zavistic Rarve. With your second vial, he will teleport you to Betty's shop after selecting the chat option \"''Can you help me more?''\".\n[[File:Betty chathead.png|left]]\nSpeak to Betty about the quest, and she will take the vial and give you a [[bottled water]]. You need to add redberries to make [[redberry juice]], then add white berries to make [[pink dye]]. Once you've made some, use it on your [[lantern lens]] to create a [[rose tinted lens]].\n\nTalk to Betty again. Then, stand in the doorway while the door is open, and shine your lens at the counter (click on it in your inventory, then use it on the counter) to fill up a vial with [[truth serum]]. You now need a personal item from Sandy to fill up the vial. Talk to Betty again to use the sand you previously found in Sandy's pocket. Give it to Betty to finish the serum.\n\n===Sandy Truth-Be-Told===\n'''''Items needed:''' [[Truth serum]]''\n[[File:The Hand in the Sand - Sandy confesses.png|thumb|300px|Sandy confesses to killing Clarence, thanks to the truth serum.]]\nBack in [[Brimhaven]], talk to [[Sandy]]. Get him distracted (try all the options, as there is no guaranteed one that will work). Once he looks out the window, use the serum on his coffee. Then, activate your Magical orb and talk to him. He'll confess that he bribed a wizard to put a mind-altering spell on [[Bert]]. He then changed Bert's schedule so that he'd work longer for the same pay. Afterwards, Sandy killed the wizard so that he wouldn't have to pay him; then, he buried parts of him in all of the sandboxes around ''RuneScape''.\n\n===And Sandy said, \"Drat- foiled again!\"===\n'''''Items needed:''' 5 [[earth rune]]s, a [[bucket of sand]].''\n[[File:Magically refilled sandpit.gif|thumb|220px|The sand magically refills, thanks to Zavistic Rarve.]]\nIf you have not already filled up your bucket with sand, stop by Bert's sand pit and fill it up before you talk to Zavistic. Back in [[Yanille]], talk to [[Zavistic Rarve]] with the Magical orb in your inventory - it is proof of Sandy's confession. Give him five earth runes and a bucket of sand. He will then cast a spell on [[Bert]]'s sandbox so that it'll fill itself to compensate Bert for his troubles. \nThen, go to [[Entrana]] (there is a bank deposite box at Port Sarim to deposit all armour and weapons before going to Entrana). Talk to [[Mazion]] by the sandpit to get the dead [[wizard's head]]. Give this to Zavistic Rarve.

The [[Squire]] will tell you he lost [[Sir Vyvin]]'s sword, and would like you to help him replace it. He will tell you to talk to [[Reldo]], [[Varrock]]'s librarian.\n\n''Note: If you have completed [[The Giant Dwarf]], you may skip talking to Reldo and go straight to Thurgo. (Your character will mention to the squire that they already know an [[Imcando dwarf]])''\n\nGo to [[Varrock Palace]], and go to the far north room on the ground floor of the palace to find Reldo. Ask Reldo about Imcando dwarves. He will tell you that one is located south of [[Port Sarim]]. If you haven't already made or bought a [[redberry pie]], do it now. [[Members]] can buy one from [[Romily Weaklax]] in the [[Cooks' Guild]] just west of Varrock (entry requires level 32 in [[Cooking]] and a [[chef's hat]]) (note: if you are an [[Ironman Mode|Ironman]] and have a low Cooking level it is useful to get the materials to bake multiple pies in case you burn one). When you have one, continue to Port Sarim and then head south.\n\n'''Note:''' You have to talk to Reldo before you talk to Thurgo.\n\n===Thurgo the Imcando dwarf===\n[[File:Thurgo location.png|thumb|Thurgo the Imcando Dwarf]]\n'''''Items required:''' [[Redberry pie]], suggested [[Falador teleport]] or [[fairy ring]] ({{Fairycode|aiq}}) (teleport to [[Pest Control]] via [[minigame teleport]]s is faster than walking)''\n\nYou should see a small house on the side of a hill with a red exclamation mark. Look for [[Thurgo]], who is an Imcando dwarf. Ask him if he would like some [[redberry pie]]. He'll take the one you have and eat it. Talk to him again to ask him about the sword. He says he'll need a picture of it. So, go back to [[Falador]] and talk to the [[Squire]] again.\n\n===Acquiring the picture===\n'''''Items required:''' none''\n\n'''Note:''' You have to talk to the Squire first before searching for the portrait.\n\nYou ''must'' go talk to the squire again who will tell you that [[Sir Vyvin]] has a portrait in his room. From the courtyard of the [[White Knights' Castle]] in [[Falador]], go east through three doors, and then up the ladder. Go west through the door and then through another doorway and up the stairs. Sir Vyvin's room will be directly south of you. Open and search the cupboard inside his room. You will obtain a portrait that shows the sword. However, Sir Vyvin will stop you if he is in the room. There are four ways to avoid this:\n\n*Have a friend talk to [[Sir Vyvin]] while you open and search the cupboard. You can also wait for Sir Vyvin to be out of the cupboard room if you don't have friend near.\n*Open the door to his room and wait for him to walk out.\n*Have the door open, and wait next to the cupboard. When Sir Vyvin walks behind the door, quickly search the cupboard.\n*The cupboard is searched while Sir Vyvin is not looking towards the player.\n\nOnce you have the portrait, you're done at [[White Knight's Castle]] for now.\n\n===Getting the iron bars (optional)===\n'''''Note: '''If you already have 2 iron bars (4 if you want your own sword), or will definitely buy them, skip this part. Bring food for all four of the alternative options below.''\n\nIf you don't already have the iron bars, you can get them very easily by buying them from the [[Grand Exchange]]. Make sure you bring them when you're going to [[Thurgo]] next, as it saves you a trip to a nearby bank. If you're an [[Ironman]], and you wish to obtain them without buying or [[Smithing]], you have 4 options. The first three involve killing (so at least the ability to survive a fight is necessary), the last one involves a trip to the [[Wilderness]].\n\n'''Killing dwarves'''\n\nThe first one is to kill [[Dwarf|Dwarves]], head to either the ground floor or beneath the [[Dwarven Mines]] to find groups between combat level 10 & 14, which have a rare chance of dropping one iron bar.\n\n====Killing pirates====\nThe second one is to take food from your bank, go to [[Thurgo]] without iron bars, talking to him, heading to the [[Asgarnia Ice Dungeon]] on the hill nearby and killing the [[Pirates]] there, as they have a rare chance of dropping one iron bar. They have a combat level of 26, and can be easily [[safespot]]ted.\n\n====Killing white knights====\nThe third one is to go to the [[White Knight's Castle]], bring some [[Magic]] (they have a weakness to Magic) or [[Ranged]] gear, and safespot [[White Knights]] on the second floor of the castle, in the jail-like room. Compared to the [[Pirate]]-option above, this requires more effort to get there and to kill a single one, but the drop rate of iron bars for [[White Knights]] (level 36, 38 and 42; '''not''' the level 39 ones) is uncommon instead of rare, and they can drop max. 2, instead of one. That makes it a viable option if you want to save time. They do have twice as many hitpoints compared to Pirates, so a high combat level (45+) is recommended.\n\n====Wilderness spawn====\n[[File:The Knight's Sword - Iron bar spawn.png|thumb|220x220px|The location of the iron bar.]]\nThe fourth option: a single iron bar can be found west of the\u00a0[[Graveyard of Shadows]]\u00a0next to the\u00a0[[bear]]s in some trees in level 18\u00a0Wilderness (hop to another world for more). Bring a [[teleport]] to get out of the [[Wilderness]] quickly after you have what you need.\n\n===Enter the dungeon===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[pickaxe]], food (recommended), 2 [[Iron bar]]s (to save a bank trip).''\n\n''Don't forget to bring your pickaxe for this next step, and if you are at a low [[combat level]], make sure that you take food with you as well! If needed there is an altar just north of the dungeon to restore prayer points.''\n\nNow that you have the portrait, talk to [[Thurgo]], and give it to him. He now knows what kind of a sword he is making, a [[blurite sword]], and he will need the materials to make the sword. You will have to enter the [[Asgarnia Ice Dungeon]] on the hill nearby to obtain the [[blurite ore]]s. All enemies in the cave are [[aggressive]], so bringing [[food]] could save your life. It is also recommended that you only bring a good pickaxe if you want two blurite ores so that you can get your own sword (you also need a Blurite ore for the Falador Easy Achievement Diary - to smith Blurite limbs on [[Doric]]'s anvil). So, go down the ladder and walk through. When you see snow/ice ahead of you, be prepared to run. Run along the southern walls to find blurite ores. The rocks are bright blue. Mine one ore or two if you want your own sword. When you have the amount of blurite you want, run out. If you want to do the [[Falador Diary|Falador Achievement Diaries]], mine an extra blurite ore as it is necessary for a one of the easy tasks.\n\nIt may be helpful to have a bodyguard to protect you from the aggressive monsters; however, if done correctly, a level 3 player can get the ore. If you die you will retain the ore, however, this obviously doesn't apply to [[Hardcore Ironman]] characters.\n\n''Note that there is a spot where the monsters cannot attack you. It is right next to the entrance to the members-only area of this dungeon. It is recommended that you mine at the blurite ore rock right next to this area, so you can easily retreat to safety if necessary.''\n\n===Creating the sword===\n'''''Items required:''' 2 [[Iron bar]]s, and a [[blurite ore]]. (Or 4 Iron bars, and two blurite ore if you want your own sword)''\n\nGet back to [[Thurgo]] with your [[blurite ore]]s and your iron bars. He will make you a sword. If you want a sword for yourself, drop the sword Thurgo just made and talk to him again with the materials (you could also wield the sword instead of dropping it). He will make a second sword. Then, pick up the sword you dropped. You now have two swords.\n\n===Finishing up===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Blurite sword]] (suggested [[Falador teleport]]).''\n\nGo back to the [[Squire]] and he will take one of your blurite swords. After handing over the sword you will be done with the quest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Knight's Sword\n|image = [[File:The Knight's Sword reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*12,725\u00a0[[Smithing]] [[experience]]\n*A [[blurite sword]] (if you got [[Thurgo]] to make you an extra one)\n*The ability to smelt [[blurite ore]] into [[blurite bar]]s (members)\n}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*When trying to complete the quest while having the [[blurite sword]] equipped, the [[Squire]] would say \"So can you un-equip it and hand it over to me now please?\"\n*If the player's [[Smithing]] level is 1, they will have it levelled up to 29 after this quest.

Sigmund will join in on the conversation, which will be slightly different if you have completed [[Dragon Slayer]]. After the conversation is finished, you'll be able to go down to the basement and use your [[pickaxe]] on the rubble.\n\nGo down the trapdoor in the kitchen, and look for a blocked tunnel (rubble) on the east side of the cellar. Use your pickaxe on it. Light your [[Light sources|light source]], then squeeze through, grab the [[brooch]], and turn back. Otherwise, you'll fall into a pit.\n\nGo back to the duke and show him the brooch.

He'll tell you to search the bookcases for a book on goblin history. The book is at the northwestern portion of the room - the furthest up the west wall of the room.\n\nTurn to the last page to see that the symbol on the brooch translates to \"[[Dorgeshuun]], goblins of the strong spears\". Keep the book for the remainder of the quest since it's very important.\n\n===Goblin history===\nHead to [[Goblin Village]], and talk to [[General Wartface]] and [[General Bentnoze]]. They'll argue about minor things just like they did in [[Goblin Diplomacy]] but eventually teach you the goblin victory dance and ceremonial bow [[emotes]].\n\nDuring the dialogue with the Generals, you should choose the following options:\n[[File:The Lost Tribe - goblin generals teach greetings.gif|thumb|220px|The goblin generals teach the player the goblin greetings.]]\n# Have you ever heard of the Dorgeshuun?\n# It doesn't really matter\n# Well either way they refused to fight\n#  Well I found a brooch underground...\n# Well why not show me both greetings?\n\nYou will then receive confirmation you've learned both emotes. Double check your emote page to be sure, then move on to the next section.\n\n===The tunnel system===\n[[File:Dorgeshuun Tunnels.png|frame|centre|A map of the tunnels.]]\nGo back to [[Lumbridge]], and talk to the duke. He will tell you to investigate the caves further. Go back into the tunnel. '''See the map for the correct path.''' If you go the wrong way, one of two things will happen:\n[[File:The Lost Tribe - tunnel symbol.png|thumb|220px|One of the symbols on the rock.]]\n#A rock will fall in front of you or on top of you (if you're lucky).\n#You'll fall down a trapdoor and end up in the main part of the [[Lumbridge Swamp Caves]]. If you're using a [[candle]], you will almost certainly die because the candle will constantly cause gas explosions, so use the [[Home Teleport]] or another [[Teleportation|teleport]]. (Alternatively, you can try to find your way back through the hole you created earlier, using [[food]] and [[Prayer]] as necessary.)\n\nThe way through the cave is the same for all players. See the map.\n\n===Contact===\nWhen you reach the end, you'll find the [[Dorgeshuun]] tribe. Talk to [[Mistag]], and do your [[Goblin Bow]] in front of him. He will tell you that the Dorgeshuun are actually peaceful, and the Lumbridge kitchen thing was an accident. You'll also learn about the [[goblin]]s' backstory. Mistag will offer to take you back to [[Lumbridge]] if you ask him to show you the way out. Agree.\n\n===Missing silverware===\n[[File:The Lost Tribe - H.A.M. cult location.png|thumb|150px|Trapdoor location]]\nSpeak with the duke. Some [[silverware]] was stolen from the castle basement, and the goblins are being blamed for it. [[Pickpocket]] [[Sigmund]] and unlock his chest (located in the [[spinning wheel]] room) to find some [[H.A.M. robes]] (keep them as you'll need these for [[Death to the Dorgeshuun]], the sequel [[quest]]).\n{{Clear}}\n[[File:The Lost Tribe - silverware location.png|thumb|160px|The [[silverware]]!]]\n[[File:The Lost Tribe - the peace summit.png|thumb|220px|The meeting between Duke Horacio and Ur-tag.]]\nTell the [[Duke Horacio|duke]] that Sigmund is part of [[H.A.M.|Humans Against Monsters]]. Then exit through the west side of Lumbridge castle and go to the [[H.A.M. Hideout]] (the trapdoor is directly west of the [[general store]]; pick the lock, YOU DO NOT NEED A LOCK PICK). You will find the stolen silverware in the crates in the first room. Give it back to the duke, who will fire Sigmund.\n\n===Peace===\nThe [[Duke Horacio|duke]] will give you a peace treaty. He will sign it and tell you to get the leader of the [[Dorgeshuun]] to sign it as well. Go into the tunnel. This time, you won't have to navigate through yourself because you'll see a new goblin there, [[Kazgar]], that you will follow to the mines.\n{{Listen\n|title = Peace summit\n|align = right\n|filename = The Lost Tribe - peace summit.ogg\n|desc = The music track that only plays during the cutscene.}}\nTalk to [[Mistag]].

He is conducting an investigation on behalf of the [[Kourend Council]] to investigate unusual happenings in the Piscarilius House. A new gang called the Saviours of Kourend has recently formed, absorbing many of the other gangs, and have become the largest gang in [[Kourend]], with more joining them each day. According to him, their leader is The Queen of Thieves. Tomas attempted to infiltrate the gang with little success, so he requires someone that looks poor to infiltrate them. Agree to help him.\n\n===Discovery===\n[[File:Robert O'Reilly chathead.png|left]]\nDirectly west, speak to either the [[poor looking woman]] or [[poor looking man|man]] and ask about the Saviours of Kourend's location. They don't know where they can be found, but they do know a man who has been working with them: [[Robert O'Reilly]]. He can be found in the building directly south, in the room to the right of [[Kenelme]]. In order to reveal the location of the Saviours of Kourend, he will ask for a [[stew]]. Items to make the stew can be purchased from Kenelme in the house directly to the west, and a bowl can be purchased from the [[Leenz's General Supplies|general store]]. Give it to him, and he will tell you they are located in [[The Warrens]], whose entrance is located a short walk to the east, marked by the [[File:Dungeon map link icon.png]] icon.\n\n===Infiltration===\n[[File:Devan Rutter chathead.png|left]]\nEnter the manhole to the east. Go a little bit south and head west over the two small bridges (they aren't on the minimap) to arrive at the large island. Talk to [[Devan Rutter]]. You will ask to join the gang, but he will want you to kill [[Conrad King]], a senior member of a rival gang, the Vipers, to prove your loyalty. Conrad King is on the dock on the southern side of the Piscarilius mess hall (the largest building, to the east). You have the option to kill him 'brutally' or 'softly.' Choosing 'softly' results in a humorous dialogue stating that this is impossible, causing you to kill him 'brutally' anyway.\n\n===The truth===\n[[File:Lady Shauna Piscarilius chathead.png|left]]\nReturn to [[Devan Rutter]]. Then, enter the tent north of him and speak to the Queen of Thieves. You will attempt to arrest her, but she tells you the truth about the gang: Before they came along, Kourend was filled with violent gangs who steal and kill, but the Saviours of Kourend pick particular targets, removing people of power and giving it back to those who keep the kingdom alive. She will reveal that she is none other than the leader of the Piscarilius House, [[Lady Shauna Piscarilius]], and that The Queen of Thieves is her alias that strikes fear into the rich and degenerate.\n[[File:The Queen of Thieves - searching chest.png|thumb|250px|Searching the chest in Councillor Sophia Hughes' home.]]\nYou will doubt her claims, so she tells you about the current leadership situation, and the corruption of the Kourend Council.\n[[File:Councillor Hughes' house location.png|thumb|left|200px|The location of Councillor Hughes' house.]]\nTo prove she is telling the truth, she will ask you to search [[Councillor Hughes]]' home, as they believe she has ties with the [[Disciple of Yama|Disciples of Yama]].\n\nTravel to [[Hosidius House]]. You'll find Councillor Hughes' home is located across the street from the [[Hosidius House]] General Store, [[Little Shop of Horace]], slightly to the north-east. She is not home, so simply pick the lock and search the chest to find a [[Letter (The Queen of Thieves)|letter]], which proves Shauna's claims.\n\n===Finishing up===\nReturn to [[Tomas Lawry]] and give him the [[Letter (The Queen of Thieves)|letter]]. Reading the contents of the letter, he will forget about the Queen of Thieves, believing Councillor Hughes' ties with the [[Disciples of Yama]] is more pressing, and plans to report it to the Council immediately.\n\nReturn to [[Lady Shauna Piscarilius]]. She will tell you that [[Councillor Hughes]] has been arrested, and admits that you're not totally useless after all. She continues, saying that her arrest is only the beginning, and there's still much work to be done. Lastly, she will tell you that she may call on your help once more, or maybe not. She will then give you your rewards.\n\n'''Congratulations, quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = The Queen of Thieves\n|image = [[File:The Queen of Thieves reward scroll.png|center]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards =\n*{{Skill clickpic|Thieving|2,000}} [[Thieving]] experience\n*2,000 [[coins]]\n*Access to [[The Warrens]]\n*[[Piscarilius favour certificate]].

He needs you to help him. He wants you to talk to [[Father Urhney]], located in a house west of [[Lumbridge Swamp]], and get some information from him on ghosts.\n\n===Finding Father Urhney===\n[[File:Father Urhney location.png|thumb|left]]\nGo south of the castle, and then keep going west in the swamps. You'll soon come upon a small house. Go inside, and talk to [[Father Urhney]] about [[Father Aereck]] needing help with the [[Restless ghost|ghost]] haunting the graveyard. He will give you an [[amulet of ghostspeak]]\u00a0so that you're able to talk to the ghost. ('''Note: You will need the amulet of ghostspeak for 8 later quests, so keep it in your bank after the quest'''. If you ever lose it, [[Father Urhney]] will give you another for free. It's advised to obtain multiple amulets via the [[drop trick]] just in case.) Now, go back to the graveyard in [[Lumbridge]],\u00a0and go to the marble coffin that is located in a small house by the graveyard.\n\n===Freeing the ghosts===\nWear your [[amulet of ghostspeak]] and search the coffin. Talk to the [[Restless ghost|ghost]] who comes out. He will tell you he is missing his skull and wants you to get it for him. He will say he was near the [[Wizards' Tower]] on an island south of [[Draynor Village]].\n[[File:The Restless Ghost - Battle.png|thumb|272px|Fighting the Skeleton in the [[Wizards' Tower]].]]\nHead to the Wizards' Tower, and climb down the ladder in the room directly next to the entrance.

Kill it or run, and make sure you have the skull in your inventory. Then, go back to the graveyard.\n\nTalk to the ghost. He'll want you to put it in his coffin.

He'll tell you about the city of [[Witchaven]], which has had some rather strange things going on recently. He'll tell you to check in with their local agent in Witchaven, [[Col. Jake O'Niall]]. Give your [[Commorb]] to Sir Tiffy Cashien to upgrade it to Commorb v2, which will start the quest; then use the contact option on Commorb v2 and head to Witchaven.\n\n===Witchaven===\n[[File:Witchaven map.png|left|thumb|300px|A map of Witchaven.]]\n[[O'Niall]] sits on a rocking chair on the pier at the north-east corner of town. Talk to him, and he'll tell you that some of the people have been acting strangely recently, especially [[Mayor Eustace Hobb]]. Recently, he started looking rather sickly and working feverishly to restore the ancient, ruined [[Witchaven Dungeon|shrine]] just west of town (between [[Witchaven]] and [[Ardougne]]). Before leaving, ask O'Niall about who the important people in town are, which are [[Mayor Hobb]], [[Brother Maledict]], and [[Holgart]]. Speak to each of them in any order.\n\n====The mayor====\nAlthough you can speak to any of the important people in any order, you can start off by heading to [[Mayor Hobb]]'s house. It's the one at the north-west side of [[Witchaven]]. Talk to him, and ask him about Witchaven or the shrine. When you are done speaking to him, don't go anywhere as [[Savant]] will stop you. She'll ask you to scan the mayor, so click on the [[Commorb]] to scan. Once she's finished speaking, go to the church, and talk to [[Brother Maledict]].\n\n'''NOTE: You may need to finish the dialogue with Mayor Hobb with \"Nothing at the moment thanks\" after asking the questions to make Savant ask you to scan him. It takes 3\u20134 seconds before she contacts you after ending the conversation.'''\n\n====Brother Maledict and Holgart====\n[[Brother Maledict]] will mention that he's a bit worried about some of his congregation, who have begun to act a little bit strangely lately. After asking him any of the available options, walk a little bit north, and talk to [[Holgart]], who'll tell you that the mayor recently took his boat and gave it to another man named [[Jeb]], standing near by.\n\n===The shrine===\n[[File:Slug menace wall.png|right|thumb|200px|The false wall.]]\nReport back to [[O'Niall]] again to tell him what you have found out so far. He'll suggest you go look into the [[Witchaven Dungeon|shrine]] that the [[Mayor Hobb|mayor]] is so interested in.\n\n[[File:Witchaven dungeon map.png|right|thumb|The dungeon.]]\nWalk a little ways west of town, and climb down the stairs to get into the shrine. Once you're inside, look at the [[minimap]]. You can see a red portion of wall indicating where there's a false wall that can be pushed open. Do so, and you'll be let in to a new area. Inside are some aggressive level 45 [[giant lobster]]s in a winding tunnel. Walk through it, or take the [[Agility]] [[shortcut]] to get to where there's an imposing door blocking your way. Walk up to it (You don't need to try to open it, and you will take 5 damage if you do), and [[Savant]] will contact the [[Commorb]] to tell you about the strange markings on the door. Scan the Commorb for her. She can't read them and suggests you take them to [[Jorral]] to try to find out what they mean. Make sure you have inventory space, as you will '''not''' get the notes if your inventory is full. Pick up the [[dead sea slug]] off the floor before leaving and head to Jorral's house, which is located at an [[outpost]] just north-west of [[West Ardougne]].\n\n===The pages===\n'''''Items needed:''''' ''[[Swamp paste]] and five open inventory spaces''[[File:Outpost location.png|left|thumb|Jorral is found in the outpost due north of West Ardougne.]]\nNow, go talk to [[Jorral]], who is at his [[Outpost]]. After some coaching from [[Savant]] on what to say, Jorral will translate the message for you. As you leave the building again, Savant will contact you again to let you know just what this new revelation entails. Head back to [[Witchaven]] again, and report in with [[O'Niall]]. He'll suggest you go talk to the [[Brother Maledict|priest]] and see if he knows anything about how to open the door. As you approach the church, you'll see a brief cutscene of the [[Mayor Hobb|mayor]] leaving the church and when you go in, the priest will be looking rather ill and acting strangely. Anyway, when you ask him about the door, he'll tell you that he has a book that might be of use, but the three most important pages are missing.\n\nFor the [[Page 1|first one]], go to the mayor's house and look in his desk. The [[Page 2|second one]] will be given to you by [[Ezekial Lovecraft]], the owner of the [[Fishing]] store, [[Lovecraft's Tackle]], when you talk to him. For the [[Page 3|last one]], go talk to O'Niall again. He too has taken the same look as the rest of the villagers. He'll give you the last page, but unfortunately, it has been ripped into three pieces. You, therefore, have to have five open spaces in your backpack for two whole pages and three pieces of the third page.\n\nTry to use [[swamp paste]] on any of [[Fragment 1]], [[Fragment 2]], or [[Fragment 3]] to glue the page back together, but [[Savant]] stops you. The oily tar would ruin the ancient parchment, she warns. Instead, she advises, to make sticky glue from a rendered slug, and she mentions that it can only be done by someone who is renowned in seafood cooking.\n\n[[File:The slug menace page puzzle.png|thumb|325px|The solution of the puzzle.]]\nTravel to the [[Fishing Platform]] by talking to [[Jeb]], who is next to Holgart. Talk to [[Bailey]] in the small room on the south west corner of the platform. Hand him the dead slug you picked up earlier from the shrine, and in a few seconds, he gives you the [[sea slug glue]] you need. Finally, use the glue on the fragments, and a puzzle will pop up.\n\nYou can move the three pieces around using the buttons on the side, turn them, and even flip them over. The easiest way to tell if you've got them all on the right side is that one side is lighter than the other. It doesn't matter which way you have it, but the light side has an image on it. When you put the pieces in their correct place, the puzzle will close automatically. The picture will give you a general idea of how they should look.\n\n===Crafting the runes===\n'''''Items needed: '''Commorb, at least 5 rune or pure essence (it is recommended to bring more), chisel, tiaras/talismans for entering the air, water, fire, earth, and mind altars (not necessary if using the abyss)''\n\nTo do the next part, you'll need to get your [[chisel]] and at least five [[rune essence|rune]] or [[pure essence]]. Right-click on each page, and select the options to make the runes into the [[Blank air rune|shape of air]], [[Blank water rune|water]], [[Blank fire rune|fire]], [[Blank earth rune|earth]], and [[Blank mind rune|mind]]. It is possible to fail this and break a rune, and be careful not to use the chisel on the essence, or you get fragments. Now, you need to go to each of the odd shaped essences' respective [[Runecrafting#Altars|altars]] and use them on them (e.g. earth on the [[earth altar]], fire on the [[fire altar]], and so on). '''It is also possible to fail to enchant the shaped essence at the altar, thus destroying it.''' Keep your pages, chisel and spare essence handy as you make your way to the various altars. Using an [[Amulet of glory]] and the [[Abyss]] will shorten this process.\n\n===The imposing door===\n'''''Items needed: '''Commorb, melee weapon, the 5 created runes from the previous section''\n\n[[File:The Slug Menace slug prince.png|left|thumb|200px|The Prince appears!]]Now, to open the final door. Head back to [[Witchaven]] and prepare for a fight; bring your newly created runes and [[Commorb]]. Then, go down into the [[Witchaven Dungeon|shrine]] again. Use each of the runes you made on the door to trigger another cutscene. You see that [[Mayor Hobb]] tricked you into opening the door so that [[Mother Mallum]] could escape.\n{{Listen\n|title = The Slug Prince\n|align = right\n|filename = The Slug Menace - the Slug Prince.ogg\n|desc = The music track that only plays during the encounter with Mayor Hobb.}}\nAfter that, you'll have to fight a level 62 [[Slug Prince]]. It isn't that hard to kill, however''' you can only use [[Melee]] to damage it'''. Its attacks drain your [[Prayer]] by the amount of damage dealt.\n{{Listen\n|title = Mother Mallum\n|align = right\n|filename = The Slug Menace - Mother Mallum appears.ogg\n|desc = The music track that only plays during the encounter with Mother Mallum.}}\n[[File:The Slug Menace - Mother Mallum appears.png|thumb|left|200px|Confronting the slug queen.]]\nOnce you kill it, you'll be treated to another cinematic introducing you to [[Mother Mallum]]. The situation gets too hot to handle, and [[Savant]] will teleport you to [[Falador Park]], just steps away from turning the quest in by talking to [[Sir Tiffy]].\n\n'''Congratulations!

The pack costs 25,000 coins.\n**Buying the upgraded armour in separate pieces cost more: the helm costs 8,000 coins, the platelegs and plateskirt cost 10,000 coins, and the platebody costs 12,000 coins for a total of 30,000 coins.\n}}\n\n==Trivia==\n*[[Mayor Hobb]] is currently the only known human victim of the [[sea slug]]s' control who achieved metamorphosis into a more aquatic creature, likely due to his long time possessed.\n*Hobb's beard's style changes after he is possessed.\n*[[Col. Jake O'Niall]] may be a reference to ''{{wp|Stargate|Stargate's}}'' {{wp|Jack O'Neill|Col. Jack O'Neill}}, both seem to have an affinity for fishing. Jake is also \"semi\" retired (while still retaining security clearance), as Jack was several times throughout the show. Jake also gets possessed by a [[sea slug]], which seems to be an obvious reference to the {{wp|Goa'uld}}, a parasitic race of worm-like aliens that take over a host completely.\n*In addition to the obvious ''Stargate'' references, when the Mayor leaves the church and says: \"Welcome to the family\" it may be a reference to the Slitheen Family from Doctor Who. \n*[[Ezekial]]'s last name is a reference to the famous American author of horror, fantasy and science fiction, [[wikipedia:H. P. Lovecraft|Howard Phillips (\"H.P.\") Lovecraft]]. Ezekial mentions his family have always been either bait sellers or writers, and mentions his relative Howard. This is further confirmed by the nature of the quests he's involved in.\n*Instead of \"Trade\", like all other shop owners, Ezekial has a right-click option \"Shop\" that opens the shop's window.\n*Ezekial's favourite food is [[tuna]], which is made clear in ''{{RSL|RuneScape 3|RuneScape 3's}}'' {{RSL|Salt in the Wound|Salt in the Wound}}, for when fed any tuna-related item (such as a [[tuna potato]] with [[sweetcorn]]) he will exclaim \"Tuna! My favourite!\" and is healed a much higher amount of [[Hitpoints]] than normal.\n*The scarf around Maledict's neck gets a gold trim when he is possessed.\n*Col. O'Niall makes a military in-joke 'Don't Sir me, boy, I work for a living.' This refers to petty/warrant officers in the military who, while technically being officers, don't hold a royal commission. The joke being that officers with a commission are just management roles and don't do any of the actual work.

Once you've climbed out, climb the rocks, then the cliff, and then the rocks once more to escape the camp. You can enter through the gate once more.

You also can refill your waterskin from the bowl.\n\nExit the hut and run to the east wall by the rocks. Talk to the male slave. He will tell you that he's planning on making an escape.

Start with \"I wanted to have a chat?\" He will insist that you leave. Next say \"You seem to have a lot of books!\" He will reply and agree that he does. Now say \"So you're interested in sailing?\" and he will perk up and say that it's been a passion of his for most of his life. Finally, reply \"I could tell by the cut of your jib.\" Saying this will flatter him and he'll begin rambling off about sailing stories and will be distracted enough for you to unlock his Chest and steal the blueprints.\n[[File:The Tourist Trap - making the prototype dart.png|thumb|220px|Making the prototype dart tip for Al Shabim.]]\nThis will get him distracted enough for you to search the chest.

''\"Prison riot in ten minutes, get your cart out of here!\"''\u00a0(you could also choose to bribe the driver instead)\n*2. ''\"You can't leave me here, I'll get killed!\"''\nSearch the cart and get on it.

If you don't have [[flowers]] yet, you can buy them from the [[Flower Girl]] in the castle courtyard. \n\nSpeak to [[King Vargas]] located upstairs in the castle (southwest) to begin the quest. He will agree to let you be ruler of the kingdom if you can marry either his [[Princess Astrid|daughter]] or [[Prince Brand|son]], make peace with [[Etceteria]], and gain the support of the population.\n\n===Marrying===\n:'''Important:''' This part can be confusing for some players, especially because either NPC can get in a constant \"Good Day Sir/Madam\" loop even after giving them items such as flowers and doing an emote, you may need to cheer or clap (for the prince) or dance (for the princess) '''several times'''. Also, do '''not''' change your gender at the [[Make-over mage]] midway. If you do so, you'll have to do this part over.\n\n====Princess Astrid (if male)====\nEnter [[Princess Astrid]]'s room, which is north of the throne room, and speak with the Princess of [[Miscellania]]. Start to tell her about your desire to become regent. She interrupts you to say she has many suitors. She will, however, give you a chance to impress her.\n\nSpeak to the princess a few times, and agree with whatever she says. Then, use the [[flowers]] on her. You can buy [[mixed flowers]] for 15 [[coins]] from the [[Flower Girl]] in the marketplace just outside the building from where the king presides. Now, use the [[Dance]] [[Emotes|emote]] in her room.\n\nSpeak to her a few more times, responding with agreeable answers. Once she has nothing left for you to agree with, use a [[bow]] (No Longbows, Comp Bows, Or Magic Bows) (the weapon, not the emote) on her.\n\nAgain, speak to her a few more times. When she calls you \"dear\" and you call her \"darling\", select the [[Blow Kiss]] emote. Use the Blow Kiss emote on her before you give her the [[ring]].\n\nOnce she has nothing left for you to agree with, use the ring on her. She finally agrees to marry you. She says you two will have to put off the actual ceremony until you can find a priest, but you can tell her [[King Vargas|father]] of the marriage.\n\n====Prince Brand (if female)====\nEnter [[Prince Brand]]'s room, which is south of the throne room, and speak with the Prince of [[Miscellania]]. Start to tell him about about your goal of becoming ruler of the kingdom. He interrupts you and asks why he would be interested in a \"crass adventurer like yourself?\" He will, however, give you a chance to impress him.\n\nContinue to talk with the prince, selecting the most flattering answers, until he asks if you would like to hear his poem. Tell him, of course, you would love to. After he recites his poem, select \"Be still, my heart\" and use the [[Clap]] or [[Cheer]] [[Emotes|emote]]. He thanks you. Speak with him some more, responding with flattering answers, and then use the [[flowers]] on him. When he asks if they are for him, say, \"Yes\".\n\nContinue to talk with the prince (he will ask you your name), providing him with flattering answers, until he asks if you would like to hear his saga. You wonder if you have the time to hear a whole saga, but he launches into it anyway. Continue to flatter and talk with the prince, give him the [[cake]] or [[chocolate cake]], and tell him it is for him (be careful not to eat it).\n\nWhen he calls you \"my darling\", select the [[Blow Kiss]] emote and use the [[ring]] on him. If he says he could not possibly accept the ring, keep talking to and flattering him. Eventually, after you blow him a kiss and use the ring on him, he says, \"Is this for me? Really?\". Say \"Yes\".\n\nYou ask the prince to marry you, and he says \"Yes!\" He says that you two love birds will have to put off the actual ceremony until you can find a priest but you can tell his [[King Vargas|father]] he has agreed to marry you.\n===Peace deal===\nTalk with [[Advisor Ghrim]], who is off to the side behind the king, and ask him how to make peace with [[Etceteria]]. He tells you to talk with [[Queen Sigrid]] of Etceteria. Head east, cross the bridge over into Etceteria, enter the large building in the east side of town, go upstairs, and enter the centre room, where you will find Queen Sigrid.\n\nSpeak to Queen Sigrid. After you tell her you have been sent by [[King Vargas]] to negotiate a treaty, she says she will agree to a peace deal if King Vargas will accept Etceteria officially as a sovereign nation. Return to Vargas, and tell him what the queen said. He says he will recognise her country if she changes Etceteria's national anthem.\n{{Listen\n|title = Awful anthem\n|desc = The awful anthem's music, which plays when obtaining the lyric sheet from Prince Brand.\n|filename = Awful anthem.ogg\n}}\nDash back to Queen Sigrid, and speak with her. Although she, at first, says it is a great anthem and that she composed it herself, she eventually agrees but requests that you come up with a new anthem. Return to [[Miscellania]], enter the room to the south of King Vargas's throne room, and speak to [[Prince Brand]]. You tell him you need a new anthem, and he agrees to write you one immediately. It is, however, terrible. He gives you the [[awful anthem]].\n\nEnter the throne room next door, and talk to Advisor Ghrim about the anthem. You give the advisor the awful anthem, and he makes a few adjustments, turning it into a [[good anthem]]. Return to Queen Sigrid, and tell her you have a new anthem. She is pleased with her new anthem and hands you a [[treaty]] - which she has already signed - to be signed by King Vargas.\n\nTake the treaty back to King Vargas, and tell him it is awaiting his signature. He says he cannot sign it with an ordinary pen. He needs a pen large enough for him to hold. Head to the northern shore of Miscellania, to the east of the mining icon, where you will find [[Derrik]]. He is in the house with the [[anvil]]. Talk to Derrik, and tell him you have a strange request. He says he can make a [[giant nib]] if you have an [[iron bar]].\n\nGive him your iron bar, and he gives you the giant nib. Use the nib on [[logs]], and you end up with a [[giant pen]]. There are a few [[evergreen]]s around the islands, so you don't need to go to the mainland if you have not brought logs. Take the giant pen to King Vargas, who then signs the treaty, bringing an end to the rivalry between the two kingdoms.\n===Public support===\n'''NOTE: The end time of the Throne of Miscellania quest determines the day reset time on the collection of resources for your Kingdom. If you'd like to collect your resources daily at a certain time, aim to finish your quest at that time.'''\n\nAfter the [[treaty]], you must get the support of the public to be the new ruler. You will need the support of 75% of [[Miscellania]] to be the new ruler. You will start off with 25%. You gain 0.33% with each action you do.\n\nIf your aim is 100% approval rating, you'll know you've hit it once your chat box tells you that you've completed a hard task for your Fremennik achievement diaries.\n\n====Good ways to get support====\n[[File:Gaining public support.png|thumb|220px|Gaining support by chopping [[maple tree]]s.]]\n*[[Rake]] the [[herb]]s and [[flax]] outside the palace walls.\n*Mine [[coal]] on the north side of [[Miscellania]].\n*Chop [[maple tree]]s in the centre of Miscellania.\n*Fish [[tuna]], [[lobster]]s, or [[swordfish]] by the docks of Miscellania ([[Barehand fishing|Barehanded fishing]] works).\n\n====Ways to lose it====\n*Kill villagers.\n*Steal from stalls.\n\nTalk to [[Advisor Ghrim]] to keep track of how much support you have.

He will tell you speak to [[Bonafido]] if you want to help.\n\n*Talk to Bonafido. He can be found lying around the boxes just north of the entrance to the tower of life - if you can convince him you're a builder by getting the outfit, he will let you into the tower. You need a hard hat, some scruffy trousers, a good top, and some hard boots. Talk to other builders to get them.\n*Talk to [['Black-eye']] to get a [[hard hat]], and answer his three questions. Here are the questions and answers:\n:#''How many nails does it take to make a rocking chair?'' - '''Three.'''\n:#''What takes 3 planks, 3 cloths and 3 nails to make, and helps remove light from a room?'' - '''Torn curtains.'''\n:#''I like fish and I want to put some in my garden, but I need a special water feature.

He says he lost a pair around the tower - just search the plants southeast of the tower to find the [[Builder's trousers]].\n*Talk to [['The Guns']], who wants a [[beer]]. Go and buy a beer for 2 [[coins]] at [[Flying Horse Inn|The Flying Horse]] pub in northwest East Ardougne or the pub at the [[Fight Arena]] or [[Yanille]] and return, give him the beer, and he will give you his [[Builder's shirt|shirt]].\n*Finally, talk to [['No fingers']] and [[Thieving#Pickpocketing|pickpocket]] him when he refuses to give you the [[Builder's boots|boots]]. Make sure that you're wearing a pair of gloves, or you won't be able to pickpocket him. If you are wearing gloves and it still fails multiple times, un-equip your gloves and continue pickpocketing.\n*Once you've acquired all the items, you must answer some questions from Bonafido for him to grant you entry to the tower. The answers are:\n:#''You've plenty of work to do, but you need a drink fast - what do you go for?'' - '''Tea.'''\n:#''Now, let's hear you whistle!'' - '''Whistle for attention.'''\n:#''What's a good sign that you need to repair your trousers?'' - '''Your legs are getting a bit cold.'''\n:#''What do you do if you cut your finger?'' - '''Carry on, it'll fix itself.'''\nAfter answering these questions, you are allowed to enter the tower. Please note that you need to wear the outfit if you want to enter the tower at any times during the quest, although it is not needed after.\n\n===Fixing up the tower===\n*A pressure machine, a pipe system, and a strange cage at the top need to be finished. A [[hammer]] and a [[saw]] (or [[crystal saw]]) are needed to fix these machines.\n*All the required items are on the {{FloorNumber|1}} in crates. Search these as required. Each crate gives the same item; search again to get more or if you get nothing the first time.\n[[File:Tower of Life Repair Supplies Location.png|thumb|centre|500px|Repair Supplies Location]]\n\n====Pressure machine (first floor)====\n'''Items needed:'''\n*4 [[Coloured ball]]s\n*3 [[Metal sheet]]s\n*4 [[Valve wheel]]s\n[[File:Tower of Life - fixing pressure machine.png|thumb|220px|The pressure machine fixed.]]\nOnce the pressure machine is built, turn the left wheel to the left until the ball plugs the hole, then to the right until the pipe fills.\n\nThen, pull the left lever, turn the 2nd wheel from the left to the left until the ball plugs the hole, and then to the right until the pipe fills.\n\nNext, turn the 3rd wheel from the left to the right until the water starts dripping, and then left once to plug the hole. Then turn it to the right until the pipe fills.\n\nNext, pull the right lever, then turn the right wheel to the right until the water starts dripping; turn the wheel left once to plug the hole.\n\nFinally, turn the right wheel to the right until the pipe fills.

If it disappears, redo the steps with the next size up.\n\nIt is helpful to remember each \"square\" of the cage is composed of 2-length pipes. So a missing pipe spanning 1\u00bd squares would need a pipe of length 3.\n\n'''Quick guide:'''\n[[File:Tower of Life repairing the cage.png|thumb|220px|Repairing The Cage]]\n#'''Horizontal:''' Size 2\n#'''Horizontal:''' Size 3\n#'''Vertical:''' Size 2\n''When each side is finished, turn the cage with the right arrow.''\n#'''Horizontal:''' Size 2\n#'''Vertical:''' Size 2\n#'''Vertical:''' Size 4\n''That side of the cage is now complete.''\n#'''Horizontal:''' Size 4\n#'''Vertical:''' Size 2\n#'''Vertical:''' Size 3\n''That side is now complete.''\n#'''Horizontal:''' Size 2\n#'''Horizontal:''' Size 2\n#'''Vertical:''' Size 2\n''The cage should now be complete!''\n\n===The Homunculus===\n*Once all three machines are properly fixed, then you must go outside and talk to [[Effigy]].

All multiple-choice answers are either magical, logical or neither. You need to push the bar at the top of the screen either to fully magical or fully logical; once done, the Homunculus will be okay. It does not matter if you push the Homunculus's mind towards magic or logic - the outcome will be the same.\n\nThere are 14 questions. Choosing a magical answer moves the arrow to the left, a logical answer moves the arrow to the right, and a neither answer does not move the arrow. If you don't move the arrow all the way to one end, then the questions repeat.

This is a British and Australian derogatory slang for a very stupid person, made popular in the British TV sitcom \"{{Wp|Only Fools and Horses}}\" (1981-1996, 2001-2003) in which the main character Derek \"Del Boy\" Trotter often referred to his daft brother Rodney as \"a right plonker\".\n*The {{Wp|Homunculus}} of {{Wp|alchemy}} were created by combining parts of different animals to create a {{Wp|hybrid}}.\n*Upon examining some floating vials, the player receives the message \"Oh, oh, oh, it's magic!\", a reference to the song {{Wp|Magic (Pilot song)|Magic}} by {{Wp|Pilot (band)|Pilot}}.\n*The player makes several references to begging during this quest, such as when talking with [['Gummy']], the player says \"Ah, come on. You know you want to '''give me free stuff'''.\", and when talking to 'Currency' the Alchemist, the player says \"Hi Currency. '''Got any spare cash?'''\"\n*After the long [[cutscene]] with the [[Homunculus]] brought to life and after talking with Effigy, the player quotes their own mother saying ''experience teaches fools'', which is an old Latin phrase - ''experientia docet stultos''.\n*Examining the barricade on the top floor of the tower gives the message \"Thou shalt not pass!\", a reference to a famous line spoken by Gandalf in {{Wp|The Lord of the Rings}}.\n*After the quest, the room north of Homunculus in the basement has an interactive light floor which turns blue when you walk on it. This may be a reference to the disco dance floor in {{Wp|Saturday Night Fever}} or the music video {{Wp|Billie Jean}}.\n*In the 3rd [[Chaos Elemental]] letter (Postbag letter number 15), the elemental hints at this quest by stating: \"In the basement of the tower of life you'll find the homunculus; he's crossing a lobster with a jubbly!

Go past the red exclamation mark.]]\nTalk to [[King Bolren]] in the centre of the [[Tree Gnome Village|Tree Gnome]] [[Gnome maze|Maze]]. He will say that three orbs have been stolen by Khazard troops. Agree to help him, and you will be taken out of the maze.\n\n===The three trackers===\n'''''Items needed for this part of the quest: 6''''' normal logs.\n\nHead north to the southern edge of the [[Battlefield]] and speak with [[Commander Montai]], who is wearing red clothing. He will ask for you to get 6 [[logs]] to repair their defences. Supply him with the logs (If you didn't have logs or an axe simply return to a bank, or alternatively, you can kill the [[goblin]]s in the maze for one. However, this will likely take longer than going to the bank), and he'll tell you that three trackers that have been sent out to retrieve coordinates to fire the ballista have not returned. He asks you to find them.\n[[File:Locations.png|thumb|220px|Tracker locations.]]\n*The first tracker is behind or on the side of the biggest building in the north-west.\n*The second tracker is in the north-east building in a Khazard Prison Cell.\n*The third tracker is roaming outside the south-west corner of the stronghold.\n\nThe first two trackers will give you the coordinates you need, which you'll automatically commit to memory. The third tracker, however, has been driven mad as a result of the chaos. Though most of what he says is garbage, he will give you a hint as to the number you need. You may have to do a bit of guesswork, though. For instance, ''\"Less than my hands\"'' would equal 1, where ''\"More than my head less than my fingers\"'' could be 2, ''\"More than we but less than our feet\"'' is 3, and lastly, ''\"My legs and your legs\"'' is 4. (It should not be any other possible number so try and remember what the third tracker said.)\n\nHead back to the ballista (not the catapult, which is next to Montai), which is located in the south-west corner of the battlefield, and you'll be given a chance to enter the third coordinate. It will be a number between 1 and 4. If you miss, just try again until you get it.\n\n===The orbs===\n[[File:Tree Gnome Village crumbled wall.png|thumb|220px|The crumbled wall you can climb over.]]\nOnce you get a hit, talk to Commander Montai once again then walk north to the stronghold (building where Gnome Tracker 1 was) and climb over the crumbled wall. When you do, you will be attacked by a level 48 [[Khazard commander]]; they have low [[Hitpoints]] (22) and should not be troublesome for most mid-levelled players (can be [[safe-spot]]ted behind northern broken chair). You can skip defeating the commander if you wish and proceed through the door into the other room.\n\n'''<span style=\"color:red\">WARNING to Hardcore Ironmen:</span>''' When you climb over the wall, a brief conversation will appear with a Khazard commander asking you how you got in. At the same time, he may attack you several times. The hits will not show up immediately but rather when the conversation is done, so be extra cautious if you have 12 Hitpoints or fewer.\n\nGo to the western room and climb up the ladder, retrieve the missing [[orb of protection]] from the chest inside. The commander in the room will attack you once you get close enough to him, but you can just run back down the ladder and out of the nearby door.\n\nReturn to the [[Tree Gnome Village]], and talk to [[Elkoy]] to be sent to the centre. Talk to [[King Bolren]], and he will then tell you that the other two [[orbs of protection]] have been stolen by the [[Khazard warlord|Khazard Warlord]].\n:'''Note:''' If you fight the warlord before talking to the King again, you will have to fight him again as the orbs won't drop the first time.\n[[File:Tree Gnome Village - Khazard Warlord location.png|thumb|250px|The location of the Khazard Warlord.]]\nExit the village and start heading north-west, past the level 64 [[wolves]] to the southwest edge of [[West Ardougne]], just below the Underground Pass. Talk to the [[Khazard warlord]] and kill him to retrieve the other two orbs. Although he has a rather large health pool of 170 HP, he does not hit often. Players with [[Rune armour]] and [[weapons]] should have little trouble fighting him if they have a small amount of decent quality [[food]]. Magic or ranged can also be used easily by continuing to move outside the range he can walk to.\n\n[[Magic]] and Ranged users can safespot the Khazard warlord by moving just out of range behind the small hill. The warlord will stay on the other side, and won't come towards you since you're out of his range. Spells like [[fire strike]] can then be used to kill him.\n\nThe warlord is also prone to [[flinch]]ing. By attacking him and walking west, he will stop attacking you once you have reached far enough west. If you use a Ranged or Magic attack here, the warlord will start running back east. If you run towards him and start attacking him again, he will come back to you. Run west again before he is able to reach you, and repeat the process.\n[[File:Tree Gnome Village - orbs restored.gif|frame|King Bolren returns the orbs to the spirit tree.]]\nAfter killing him, pick up the [[orbs of protection]]. Go back to King Bolren and hand over the orbs to him. A cutscene ensues, where the gnomes are seen celebrating and holding a ceremony in which the orbs are returned to their places on the sacred spirit tree.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Tree Gnome Village (quest)\n|image = [[File:Tree Gnome Village reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = \n*11,450\u00a0[[Attack]] [[experience]]\n*Use of [[spirit tree]]s for transportation\n*The [[Gnome amulet]]\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\n*[[Monkey Madness I]]\n*[[Medium Western Provinces Diary]]\n\n{{Tree Gnome Village}}"], "Tribal Totem": ["{{External|rs|rsc}}{{Has quick guide}}{{Otheruses|the quest|the quest item|Totem}}\n{{Infobox quest\n|name = Tribal Totem\n|number = 25\n|image = [[File:Tribal Totem.png|300px]]\n|members = Yes\n|release = 30 April [[2002]]\n|update = Latest RuneScape News (30 April 2002)\n|series = None\n|difficulty = Intermediate\n\n|developer = Paul Gower\n}}\n__TOC__\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Speak to [[Kangai Mau]] in [[Brimhaven]].\n|difficulty = Intermediate\n|description = Lord Handelmort of Ardougne is a collector of exotic artifacts.

Consider using the ship from [[Ardougne]] to Brimhaven (30 [[coins]] one way). Kangai is found in [[the Shrimp and Parrot]] food shop. Kangai wants help to recover a tribal totem that was stolen from the [[Rantuki Tribe]] by [[Lord Handelmort]]. Say ''\"I'm in search of adventure!\"'' and then ''\"Ok, I will get it back\"'' to start the quest.\n*Teleport or charter the [[Charter ship|Ship]] at the docks to Ardougne. [[Handelmort]] lives in the mansion west of the main square in Ardougne. Go to the house and find the door securely locked. \n*Talk to [[Horacio]], the gardener, and ask him who he is. Ask him if he gardens around the back as well. You and Horacio will talk briefly about the security around the house. He will tell you that the combination to the door lock is Handelmort's middle name.\n*The only way into the house is by using a new teleporting invention from [[Wizard Cromperty]]. Cromperty can be found in the house north-east of the [[Ardougne market]]. Ask him about his new invention. The new invention will teleport players next to a teleport block, which looks very similar to a crate. Ask Cromperty for the teleport in order to find the location of this teleport block. This happens to be in the Ardougne [[RPDT|RPDT depot]]. After the teleport, the teleport block is located in a crate to the east of the teleport location.\n[[File:Tribal Totem - RPDT.png|thumb|220px|right|R.P.D.T.]]\n*Investigate the northeastern crate to find an [[address label]], addressed to Lord Handelmort. Use this label on the eastern crate intended for the Chamber of Invention of the [[Wizards' Tower]] to cause the teleport block to be delivered to Lord Handelmort's house instead.\n*Talk to an [[RPDT employee]], and ask when the block will be delivered. Obviously, that happens very quickly after talking to them. Return to Cromperty.\n*Ask Cromperty to use his new teleport spell again. Now, the teleport is to the new location of the block in Lord Handelmort's house.\n*Inside the house, go through the west door and try to go through the next west door. There is a code lock on the second door west. The password is Lord Handelmort's middle name (found in the guide book from the real estate agent house): '''K U R T'''. Enter the code using the left and right arrows. When the password is set, click enter to unlock the door.\n*Enter the door and investigate the stairs. '''''Do not'' use the \"climb-up\" option first! '''If you try to climb-up the stairs instead of investigating it first, a trap will activate when using the stairs. The trapdoor leads to the [[Ardougne Sewer]].\n**If you fall down the trap, go south-west and climb up the ladder; then, let Cromperty teleport you back inside the house.

To get to the stronghold, use the [[Trollheim Teleport]]\u00a0or walk, or use fairy ring code {{fairycode|AJR}} and walk to the western entrance in the mountains.\u00a0From the teleport location ('''1''' on the map), go to the south/west path. Walk past some [[troll]]s, and take a ramp on the northwestern side of that area ('''2''' on the map). After entering the stronghold, use the stairs at the northern side of the corridor. Once down, take the southern corridor. At the end of the corridor, go through the door leading west. Ug is in the southern part of the room. Talk to him to learn that Ug is very much in love with [[Aga]], who, unfortunately, loves [[Arrg]]. After Ug, go to the room north of Ug to talk to Aga. She is a very romantic troll and expects to receive [[trollweiss]] from her love. Talk to Arrg to discover that he does not seem to be very much in love with Aga and also has no knowledge of the trollweiss location. The solution for Ug is to find some trollweiss so that he can win the love of Aga.\n\n===Trollweiss===\nGo talk to [[Ug]] again. He says that one who has lived their whole life in the mountains would know where to find [[Trollweiss]]. A person that is knowledgeable about the mountains is [[Tenzing]]. He lives on the path from [[Burthorpe]] to the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|stronghold]] ('''4''' on the map). Tenzing also sells [[climbing boots]]. Use the [[games necklace]] or [[Minigame Group Finder]] to teleport to Burthorpe. From the teleport location, go west and then northwest up the path. At the [[Soldier (Death Plateau)|wounded soldier]], go southwest on the winding mountain path to Tenzing's hut ('''4''' on the map).\n\n====Tenzing====\n[[Tenzing]] explains that [[trollweiss]] is in the [[ice troll]] area and a unique method is needed to go down to the [[Death Plateau (location)|plateau]] where the trollweiss grows. He also mentions that a [[sled]] may be useful for getting to that plateau and that [[Dunstan]] knows more about making a sled.\n:'''<span style=\"color:red\">Warning:</span> Make sure to talk about the sled before leaving!'''\n\n====Dunstan====\n[[Dunstan]] is the [[Burthorpe]] smith, so use a [[games necklace]] or the [[Minigame Group Finder]] to return to Burthorpe. Dunstan's house is northeast of the [[Burthorpe Games Room]] building ('''5''' on the map). Talk to Dunstan, and he will make a [[sled]] provided he gets the materials ([[Maple logs|maple]] or [[yew logs]], an [[iron bar]], and [[rope]]). Dunstan also talks about waxing the sled before it can be used in the mountain snow.\n\nWith an empty [[cake tin]] in your inventory, use the [[swamp tar]] with the [[bucket of wax]] to get wax (in the cake tin). Use the wax on the sled to make a waxed sled and making it possible to ride it. The next task is to go up [[Trollweiss Mountain]].\n\n====Trollweiss Mountain====\nThe [[sled]] needs to be used to go down [[Trollweiss Mountain]]. Return to [[Trollheim]] using the [[Trollheim Teleport]] spell, or make the longer walk. Exit the Trollheim maze on the western side, but now, take the path leading northwest, which is located north of the path to the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Troll Stronghold]]. Follow that path north, and keep west to a dungeon entrance that faces east ('''6''' on the map). The cave does not show up on the minimap and can be hard to find; once you get as far north as you can and see ice gates and the [[troll child]], look west for two rock slides, walk in between these, and go '''northwest''' to the cave. (Do '''not''' enter the ice gates as the cave is to the west, not east!) It will also be snowing around the area that the cave is in.\n:'''<span style=\"color:red\">Warning:</span> Do not spend too much time standing in the snowing area or all your stats will slowly decrease by 1.'''\n\nEnter this cave and walk through it to the northwestern corner of the cave. Beware of the [[ice troll]]s; they have a strong [[Melee]] attack. In the northwestern corner is the exit (marked red on minimap). The trolls are not near the inside of the cave, so you can wait here to regroup/get back run energy as needed.\n\nWhen outside, walk south past the [[Wolf|wolves]] to an opening in the rocks at which point you can walk no longer. Ride the sled due south, and watch the cutscene. After you stop, do not ride again. You'll see the circular area with a red dot, unequip the sled and walk in. '''Do not go all the way south on your sled!''' If you do, you will have to make your way back to the sledding path, but ride the path once away from the area with wolves.\n\n====Flower patch====\nSouthwest from the end position of the sled ride in a circular area with a central rock (easy to see on minimap) is a flower patch with [[trollweiss]]. Pick some flowers. Return to [[Ug]], who is very glad with the flowers, but he is afraid of [[Arrg]], so he cannot give [[Aga]] the trollweiss. The only option is to kill Arrg.\n\n===Fighting Arrg===\n[[File:Arrg_safespot.png|thumb|300px|The safespot for fighting Arrg.]]\nGo to the room north of [[Ug]] where [[Arrg]] is still around. Prepare for battle before talking to him. [[Protect from Melee]] is very useful, but Arrg can partially hit through it. Like most trolls, Arrg has very high strength for his combat level, and he has a max hit of 38. Talk to Arrg. When Arrg learns that you want to kill him, the big fight starts. A teleport causes the fight to take place in the [[Troll arena]] ('''7''' on the map). Arrg attacks immediately after the teleport, so be prepared. Arrg has a strong [[melee]] attack and can hit through [[protection prayers]]. He can also throw rocks, so keep switching prayers to avoid getting hit hard.\n\nArrg can be safespotted at the west gate of the arena. However, unlike [[Dad]], Arrg is small enough to fit between the mountain walls and attack you. Therefore, Arrg must be lured to the raised land at the north-west of the arena. To lure him, turn on Protect from Melee, run to about the centre of the raised land, and wait for Arrg to catch up. Once he is on the raised land, run to the gate and he should get stuck on the mountain wall. Now Arrg can not attack you at all and you can safely kill him with magic or ranged. Arrg disappears after a few minutes and he will reappear at the spot where Ug is, so even if you safespot him, you need to kill him quick.\n\nDo not worry if you die, simply teleport to [[Trollheim]] or [[Burthorpe]] and collect your items. Arrg's health will stay at the level you died at.\n\nKill Arrg and return to Ug. Tell him about the demise of Arrg to complete the quest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Troll Romance\n|image = [[File:Troll Romance reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 2\n|rewards = *{{Skill clickpic|Agility|8,000}} [[Agility]] experience\n*{{Skill clickpic|Strength|4,000}} [[Strength]] experience\n*1 [[diamond]], 2 [[Ruby|rubies]] and 4 [[emerald]]s (all uncut)\n*A [[sled]] (required to complete a hard and an elite [[clue scroll]] step)\n*Sledding route from [[Trollweiss]]\n}}\n==Trivia==\n*When threatened, Arrg states \"This concept of love confuses and infuriates us!\" This is from ''Futurama'' Season 4 Episode 4 \"''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0584446/?ref_=ttqt_qt_tt Love and Rocket]\"'' where Omicronian Leader Lrrr states a similar quote.\n*When speaking to Tenzig about the location of the Trollweiss he references global warming as a cause of the flowers being virtually inaccessible due to the snow.\n*When picking up the Trollweiss flower with no available space, your character will say in dialog \"I know it's only a flower, but I haven't got enough space...\"\n*When speaking to Aga, you ask her \" so...how's your.. um...love life?\" this is from Tommy Wiseaus' famous movie The Room.\n\n{{Troll Romance}}\n[[Category:Troll Romance| ]]"], "Troll Stronghold": ["{{External|rs}}\n{{otheruses|the quest|the location|Troll Stronghold (location)}}\n{{Has quick guide}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Troll Stronghold\n|number = 57\n|image = [[File:Troll Stronghold.png|300px]]\n|members = Yes\n|release = 24 August [[2004]]\n|update = Troll Stronghold Quest\n|series = [[List of quest series#Troll series|Troll]]\n|difficulty = Experienced\n|developer = Chris S\n}}\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Talk to [[Denulth]] in [[Burthorpe]].\n|difficulty = 3\n|description = The Imperial Guard raid was a failure, and Dunstan's son has been captured by the trolls!\n\nJourney through Trollheim to the Troll Stronghold, and rescue him!\n|length = Short-Medium\n|requirements = *Completion of [[Death Plateau]]\n*15 {{Skill clickpic|Agility}} [[Agility]] (47 is recommended)\n*The ability to defeat a level 113 [[Troll General]] (can be [[safespot]]ted)\n*30+ {{Skill clickpic|Thieving}} [[Thieving]] and 43+ {{Skill clickpic|Prayer}} [[Prayer]] are '''strongly recommended'''\n|items = *[[Climbing boots]] or 12 [[coins]] to buy them\n'''Recommended:'''\n*Good [[food]], 1-2 [[Prayer potions]], and [[armour]] are '''strongly recommended'''\n*[[Games necklace]]\n*A weapon, preferably [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]\n|kills = *[[Dad]] ''(level 101)'' (can be safespotted)\n*[[Troll General]] ''(level 113)'' (can be safespotted)\n}}\n\n==Walkthrough==\n[[File:Troll Stronghold Route.png|thumb|This is the route to the Stronghold.]]\nBring all the items needed before starting the quest as there is no nearby bank once you take the shortcut behind [[Tenzing|Tenzing's]] house.\n\nStart this quest by speaking with [[Denulth]] in [[Burthorpe]], located East of the [[Warriors' Guild]] in the tent (South of the Burthorpe teleport from the Games Necklace).

'''Tenzing\u00a0sells [[climbing boots]] for 12 [[coins]] each if you don't have them.''' Climb over the stile behind the house to begin the journey up the mountain. Follow the path until you see some rocks to the north. Put your boots on and climb over them. Then, go east and enter the arena. You will have to climb rocks several times before reaching the arena.\n\n===Dad===\n[[File:Dad's surrender.png|thumb|220px|Dad demanding that the player cease attacking.]]\nThis is where players meet a huge troll called [[Dad]]. He will say that nobody goes past without defeating him. He is level 101 and uses a tree to hit with [[Melee]]. He can hit over 20 (max of 27) and send players flying, [[Stun (status)|stunning]] them temporarily. Dad can be [[safe-spotted]] by standing next to the western gate and attacking with either [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] (using a [[halberd]] is a good Melee alternative). Note that Dad has high [[Defence]] stats against Ranged and Magic, so it may take a little bit before you kill him.\n\nWhen Dad is low on health, he will ask you to spare his life. Spare him and walk past to the gate north of the arena. Be careful as he may try to hit you still if you are in range. '''Note:''' If you don't spare his life, you can still continue the quest, although the audience will become aggressive and start attacking you!\n\nEnter the cave north of the arena, and go past the level 69 and 71 [[mountain troll]]s. Beyond this is [[Trollheim]]. There are level 68 [[thrower troll]]s who will range players here as they walk past the northern part of the mountain. You can avoid them entirely by taking a shortcut by climbing up the rocks, starting from the eastern region of the mountain and ending at the western side. Some of the shortcuts require 41- 47 [[Agility]]. If you do not have this Agility level, run around the mountain and activate [[Protect from Missiles]] around the northern bend to avoid taking too much damage from the trolls to get to the Western portion (Avoid the Northwest portion going towards the Godwars Dungeon).\n\nGo west of Trollheim and north past several mountain trolls. Enter inside the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Stronghold]].\n\n===Inside the stronghold===\n[[File:Troll Stronghold safe spot.png|thumb|220px|Safespot for the Troll General.]]\nInside are some more level 69 and 71 [[mountain troll]]s. From the entrance, walk south until you see a door on the\u00a0west wall. Enter and walk north. You will see several [[troll generals]] (level 113). They wield huge granite knives and mauls which can hit up to 38. Kill one to get a [[prison key (Troll Stronghold)|prison key]]. Use [[Protect from Melee]] or [[safe-spot]] them with [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]]. The southern-most General can be safespotted easily by standing on either side of the desk in his room. Like [[Dad]], it may take a while if killing with Ranged or Magic as they have a high defence against both.\n\n===Prison break===\n[[File:Troll Stronghold - prison guards safespot.png|thumb|220px|Safespots for Twig and Berry.]]\nOnce you have the key, go back south, down the stairs arriving in Burntmeat's Kitchen, and then go to the very north end of the [[Troll Stronghold (location)|Stronghold]]. Enter the locked door with the prison key, and climb down again to reach a jail. Head west and south, and you'll see two sleeping prison guards called [[Twig]] and [[Berry]]. Both are level 71. If you have level 30 [[Thieving]], pickpocket both to get [[Cell key 1]] and [[Cell key 2]]. (Beware, if you fail to pickpocket one, they will still attack you!) If not, kill them for the keys. You can [[safe-spot]] both trolls by standing inside one of the vacant cells. Free both [[Eadgar]] and [[Godric]] with the keys; then, exit the prison by going south to the secret exit.\n\n===Finishing up===\nHead south-east and climb over the rocks, you can use the minigame teleport or use a [[games necklace]] to return to [[Burthorpe]].

In most cases, failing any of the obstacles in an area will send you back to the beginning of the area, which can be quite frustrating, especially if your Agility is low.\n\nMany of the traps in the dungeon damage you based on your '''current''' health. This means that by keeping your health relatively low, you will have to use less [[food]] through the dungeon than you would if you were to eat to full [[Hitpoints]] each time you get damaged.\n\n===Starting the quest===\n'''''Items required:''' None.''\n\nTo begin, talk to [[King Lathas]] on the {{FloorNumber|2}} floor of [[Ardougne Castle]]. He'll tell you about the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] and the evil [[Lord Iban|Iban]] guarding it, who claims to be the son of [[Zamorak]]. He'll ask you to check in with [[Koftik]] who is waiting for you just outside the entrance to the Underground Pass.\n\nThis time, you'll be allowed to go right through the front gates to [[West Ardougne]], so head through and walk all the way west through the city until you find the cave entrance with Koftik standing outside. Talk to him, and he'll explain more about the Pass and tell you to meet him next to the bridge further inside.\n\n===Getting in and across the bridge===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[bow]], [[arrows]], and [[rope]]. Bring the rest of your supplies now, as after this section there is no turning back unless you want to restart the entire dungeon.''\n\nWhen you walk inside '''(#1)''', you'll see three paths branching off in different directions. ''('''<span style=\"color:red\">WARNING:</span> DO NOT TAKE THE MIDDLE PATH'''; the swamp will drag you down and send you tumbling down a hillside forcing you to crawl back up.)'' Instead, take the northern most path. Climb over a series of rocks around the swamp and get to where [[Koftik]] is standing next to a fire '''(#2)'''.\n\nTalk to him, and he'll tell you it looks like there have been others in the cave already. He'll give you a [[damp cloth]]. If you later need another one, you can talk to him at any time to get more. Use the damp cloth on an arrow, and then use the result on the fire to get a [[fire arrow]]. Equip a [[bow]] and this [[arrow]].\n[[File:Underground Pass - firing guide rope.png|thumb|230px|Shooting the guide rope with a fire arrow.]]\nGo north to get to the small area '''(#3)'''. Look across the subterranean river, and you can see where the guide rope holds up the bridge. Fire your lit arrow at the rope. If you succeed, the bridge will drop, and you'll automatically walk across the bridge.\n\n'''DO NOT''' pull the lever right after the bridge (it will send you back to the beginning).\n\n'''Before you continue, take the [[plank]] north of the lever (#4).'''\n[[File:UP Area 1.png|thumb|center|500px]]\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n#Cave entrance from [[West Ardougne]]\n#[[Koftik]]\n#Fire your [[Fire arrows|lit arrow]] here!\n#[[Plank]] spawn by [[blessed spider]]s\n#Use a [[rope]] on the overhang to cross the pit.\n#Grid\n#[[Furnace]]\n#Wall traps\n#Well to the second area\n{{Col-2}}\n:B - [[Giant bat]]s\n:G - [[Goblin]]s\n:O - [[Ogre]]s\n:S - [[Blessed spider]]s\n:Z - [[Zombie]]s\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===The pit===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Food]] (strongly recommended) and 1 or more [[rope]].''\n\nWalk south from where you picked up the plank. Do not walk into the swampy area filled with [[blessed spider]]s and instead head back east '''(#5)'''. You will come up on a pit and a small water crossing with a rope swing. Use your [[rope]] on the rock hanging from the ceiling.\n[[File:Underground Pass - crossing pit.png|thumb|230px|A player successfully swings across the pit.]]\n'''IF YOU FAIL AND FALL''','' you will fall into a rocky pit and lose your rope. Follow the path on your mini-map climbing over rocks when needed to get to the muddy rock pile. You'll be placed at the very beginning of [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]]. You will need another rope to attempt the obstacle again.''\n\n'''You no longer need a rope unless you have to go through the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] again.'''\n[[File:Underground pass grid.png|thumb|220px|The grid.]]\n\n===The grid===\nContinue down the path going east and then south. Eventually, you'll see [[Koftik]] standing in front of a grid '''(#6)'''.\n\nMany of the tiles will drop you into a pit '''''dealing 15 damage to your health'''''. You'll need to use trial and error finding a safe path across. Once you've found a safe way across, remember it; you'll need it for [[Regicide]]. Pull the lever once you are across to lift the gate. (The path is different for everyone.)\n\nThe grid puzzle '''always''' does 15 damage upon falling into a pit. Keep this in mind while trying new squares. Should you die from falling, your items will stay in the pit. To retrieve what you lost then, you must intentionally step on a square that will drop you into the pit. Once you get across the grid, there is an altar in the next important room, so you can use [[Rapid Heal]] to save some food. '''Remember or write down the path you used to get across. You have to come back through here *twice* during [[Regicide]] later; the correct path is permanent and unique to each player.'''\n\nIt can be useful to keep track of the route you have to take using the following grid:\n\n{| class=\"underpasstable\"\n| {{#vardefineecho:table|<table class=\"lighttable\"><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></table>}}\n| {{#var:table}}\n| {{#var:table}}\n| {{#var:table}}\n| {{#var:table}}\n|}\n\n:'''Note:''' Previously, there was a bug in which [[mithril seeds]] could be used to cross the grid without falling into pits or taking damage, as planting a mithril seed moves you one square west. This no longer works as of October 2016. Some people have said if you find your first tile you can still use mithril seeds after standing on that one, but '''this is not true''' as of 2018.\n\n===The orbs and the well===\n'''''Items required:''' A [[plank]] (optional but suggested).''\n\nTo the north of you is a [[furnace]] '''(#7)'''. For the moment, ignore it, but remember where it is.\n\n'''<span style=\"color:red\">WARNING:</span>''' '''If you use the obstacle pipe, it will cause you to go back to the rope swing with no return.'''\n\nHead west, to a narrow corridor '''(#8)'''. Approach it carefully, as there are five traps (odd markings) in the wall. (There's two on the north side followed by three on the south side.) There are three ways of passing the traps.\n\n#The traps can be foiled by standing on the square right before the trap, then '''running''' to the square immediately after the trap.\n#The traps can be disarmed normally, with a chance to fail and be hit for 5 damage.\n#Heal up as much as possible and run through the traps with no regard, possibly dying.\n\nWhichever way you choose, you will eventually get through into an area with a large, rather sinister-looking well in the middle and an [[altar]] '''(#9)'''. There are four different paths branching off from this room.\n\n'''<span style=\"color:red\">WARNING:</span>''' '''Attempting to climb down the well at this point will result in being hurt 10 damage.'''\n\n#Start with the very north one. The same trick works by simply standing a square before the trap and running ahead. Otherwise, Use the [[plank]] you picked up earlier on the flat rock to disarm the trap. Go past the traps and pick up the [[orb of light]] at the end of the tunnel.\n#The next one (the next one to the left, north-west) is fairly easy as well. Fight or run through the various [[spider]]s and level 53\u00a0[[ogre]]s to grab the orb and run back again.\n#Go through the middle path next. Navigate the traps the same way as you did for the\u00a0northern path.\n#Traverse through the tunnel (south-west path). However, when you get to where the orb is, '''don't''' pick it up. Disarm the trap underneath it, and then grab the orb.\n:'''Note:''' Disarming can be failed, triggering a swinging log, dealing 6 to 12 damage.\n\nNow that you have all four of the orbs, back track a little bit. Go back to where the furnace was '''(#7)''' (remembering to be careful of the traps in the wall). Use each of the orbs on the furnace to destroy them.\n\nMake sure to top off your prayer if needed and head down the well '''(#9)''' descending another level. If you need food, search the crates at the west (crates give two [[salmon]] and two [[meat pie]]s).\n\n===The cages and the obstacle maze===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Spade]] and [[food]].''\n[[File:UP Area 2.png|thumb|centre|250px]]\n#Entrance from the first area via climbing down the well\n#Dig by the mud patch with your [[spade]].\n#Narrow ledge\n#[[Agility]] maze\n#50 [[Thieving]] shortcut to bypass the maze\n#To the third area\n\nThere is some food in the crates right when you arrive down the well '''(#1)'''.\n\nHead west through the cave, and you'll find yourself in an area with a few cages. Pick the lock on the first one on the left (south-east). You'll notice that there's a rather odd-looking patch of ground at the back of it. Use your [[spade]] on this to dig through, and you'll find a hidden tunnel that will take you through to the other side '''(#2)'''.\n\nEdge across the narrow ledge '''(#3)''', and you'll be near a maze of raised beams '''(#4)'''. '''(ATTENTION: You can skip this step with 50 [[Thieving]] as seen in the next paragraph.)''' To get through it, you'll need to hop over a number of obstacles. If you fail, you need to climb back up one of the ramps nearby, often setting you back a few steps.\n\nTo get through the maze:\n*Take the first RIGHT.\n*Then LEFT.\n*Then another LEFT.\n\nIf you have 50 Thieving, you can go a little bit farther south past the maze. There's a door that you can pick the lock of. It completely bypasses the whole maze '''(#5)'''. '''Carefully walk around swamp patches and do not attempt to ''cross'' them, or you will fall into a long cavern that takes you to the start of the Pass.''' Once through, head south and squeeze through the pipe entrance to get into the next area.\n\n===The caged unicorn===\n'''''Items required:''' None.''\n[[File:UP Area 3.png|thumb|center|300px]]\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n#Entrance from the second area\n#[[Unicorn]]\n#[[Sir Carl]], [[Sir Harry]], and [[Sir Jerro]]\n#Well\n#To the fourth area (Iban's Lair)\n{{Col-2}}\n:S - [[Skeleton]]s\n:Z - [[Zombie]]s\n{{Col-end}}\nIn the next room, you'll find a group of [[skeleton]]s and a [[unicorn]] in a cage '''(#2)'''.\n[[File:Underground Pass - the unicorn.png|thumb|230px|The boulder that players must push down with the piece of railing.]]\nYou'll need its horn, but you can't get into the cage to get it. If you search the cage, you'll find a loose [[piece of railing]].'''(<span style=\"color:red\">WARNING:</span>''' '''If ''' '''you drop an item to make space for the railing, you will lose it and will not be able to retrieve what you drop after moving the boulder)''' Take this, and head (south) up the path above where the cage is you'll find a large boulder. Use the loose railing to pry it loose, and crush the unicorn. Now, you can go back down and retrieve the [[Unicorn horn (Underground Pass)|unicorn horn]] by searching the wreckage of the cage. Proceed through the tunnel entrance and head north.\n\n===The paladins===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Food]], [[combat]] [[equipment]], 3 [[paladin's badge]]s (red, blue, and green), and the [[Unicorn horn (Underground Pass)|unicorn horn]].''\n\nHeading north through the cave, you'll come to a small group of [[Paladin]]s who have made a sort of camp '''(#3)'''.\n\nThey're all level 62, named [[Sir Carl]], [[Sir Jerro]], and [[Sir Harry]]. If you talk to Sir Jerro, he'll give you some more food to restock your supplies.\n\nThe food Sir Jerro gives you is: 2 [[Bread]], 2 [[Meat pie]], 1 [[Stew]], 1 [[Prayer potion|Prayer potion (2)]] and 1 [[Attack potion|Attack potion (2)]]. (If you kill Sir Jerro before recieving supplies, you will not be able to get it, and he will attack you.)\n\nUnluckily for them, you need the [[paladin's badge]]s that they carry, and the only way to get those is to slaughter them. '''Make sure to talk to them before attacking them.''' It is possible to [[safespot]] the paladins by attacking them and running just south where they will not follow you.\n\nOnce you have all three badges (red, blue, and green), head west keeping your eyes out for the traps there. Again, you can foil them by placing the [[plank]] on them. ''These traps can also be foiled by standing on the square right before the trap, and running to the square immediately after the trap with run on. This method does not require a plank.''\n\nKeep going west to where there's another well '''(#4)'''. Use the [[Unicorn horn (Underground Pass)|unicorn horn]] and the three crests on the well to open the large doors '''(#5)'''.\n\n:'''Note:''' Remember this Well if you want to use the [[Iban's staff]] later. This is where you recharge it after use.\n\n===The dwarves===\n'''''Items required:''' None.''\n[[File:UP Area 4 (Iban's Lair).png|thumb|left|Iban's Lair]]\n''Now, you're in the largest area of the [[Underground Pass (dungeon)|Underground Pass]] (and indeed all of [[RuneScape]]) and one of the most frustrating. Around all edges of the area is a rock ledge to walk on. The middle is a large, open area with a maze of walkways, most of which are broken. If you try to jump across them, sometimes, you will fall and end up taking big damage when you hit the ground below, as well as being in a large area filled with [[Soulless]]. Keep in mind that this area has been known to take well over an hour to clear, so be persistent.''\n\nFor now, ignore the walkways, though do take note of the locations where you can get onto them. Head as far south as you can, and walk along the south wall until you find a small staircase leading down. \n\nWhen you walk down it, [[Koftik]] will appear, ranting insanely before disappearing again. Before he goes, though, he'll mention some [[dwarves]] that have taken up residence there. Walk west to find them. ''(Map of bottom level is found in next section.)'' There are three dwarves named [[Niloof]], [[Klank]], and [[Kamen]] in a small fenced area with two buildings.\n\nNiloof will give you some food when you talk to him. Kamen also gives an unlimited amount of food after you talk to him (see below).\n\n===The witch===\n[[File:UP Area 5 (Under Iban's Lair).png|thumb|This is the level beneath Iban's Lair.|333x333px]]\n*Talk to [[Niloof]] first about a witch named [[Kardia]] who knows how to kill [[Lord Iban|Iban]].\n*Then, talk to [[Klank]] and ask about the [[Soulless]].\n*Talk to [[Kamen]] next, who will tell you he is a little fried and asks you if you want some of his brew ''(if you '''decline''', he will offer to sell you some [[bread]], [[stew]] and a [[meat pie]] for 75 coins; if you '''accept''', you will be hit 5 HP and your [[Agility]] level will temporarily decrease by 4; however, he will give you the food).''\n\nClimb up the staircase again, and head a little to the north-east where you can see a house.\n\nFrom there, walk a little north where you can jump onto a path.\n\nWalk along it, and take the first turn south to find Kardia's house. '''<span style=\"color:red\">WARNING:</span>''' '''Do not click on the door; it will deal a lot of damage to you.'''\n\nSearch the\u00a0window,\u00a0and you'll hear her talking to herself about her missing [[cat]]. Head north, take the western path, hop across the gap, and then take the north branch of the path.\n\nFollow it until you find the cat. It will be a yellow dot on your minimap. Grab it and go back to the witch's house again (if you drop the cat, you'll have to wait for a moment before you can grab it back).\n\nUse the cat on the door. You'll automatically hide behind the corner while the witch gets her cat. While she's distracted, sneak into her house and search the chest. You'll get a [[stat restore potion]], a [[super attack potion]], the [[history of iban]] (an old journal that relates some info about Iban), and a [[doll of iban]]. ''The doll is the most important part. You now need to collect four elements of Iban to imbue the doll.''\n\n====Iban's shadow====\n'''''Items required:''' [[Combat]] [[equipment]] and the [[doll of Iban]].''\n\nTo get [[Iban's shadow]], you need to kill three level 91 [[demons]] named [[Doomion]], [[Othainian]], and [[Holthion]]. Head north and then west from the witch's house, and take the first left (south) all the way down until you reach where the demons are.\n[[File:Underground Pass - fighting Othanian.png|thumb|230px|A player uses a stone bridge to safely attack Othainian.]]\nKill each one any way you like and pick up the [[amulet of doomion]], [[amulet of othanian]] and [[amulet of holthion]] that they drop respectively. If you are a low level or are using [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]], there are [[safespot]]s for killing the demons by standing on the narrow pathways.\n\nThe last demon, [[Othanian]], may be difficult to safespot; lure him to the southern edge of the island, then run back to the narrow pathway and he will be stuck on the corner or safespot the demon from doomions isle. If using a halberd, you can safespot Othanian by staying on the narrow pathway segment that you land on after jumping over the narrow pathway. by standing Once you have all three of them, head just north of where Doomion was to the chest. Opening it will destroy the amulets and give you Iban's shadow. Use it on the [[Doll of iban|doll]].\n\n====Iban's body====\n'''''Items required:''' A [[bucket]] and a [[tinderbox]].''\n[[File:Underground Pass - burning Iban's tomb.png|thumb|220px|Iban's tomb set ablaze.]]\nEither fall or jump back to the staircase to get back downstairs. Go back to the dwarves and talk to [[Klank]]. He'll give you [[Klank's gauntlets]] and a [[tinderbox]]. Make sure you keep it.\n\nNext, grab a [[bucket]] from the larger of the two buildings if you don't already have one, and go into the smaller building. Use the bucket on the barrel inside one of the houses to get some of the [[dwarf brew]] that [[Kamen]] was giving you earlier.\n\nTake this and head to the far south-east corner of the area where Iban's tomb is. ''Note that if you try to search the tomb, you will take damage''. Dump the bucket of alcohol on top of the tomb, and light it up with your tinderbox. After you're done watching it burn, a pile of [[Iban's ashes]] will appear in your inventory (or drop on the ground). Use these ashes on the [[Doll of iban|doll]].\n\nIt is now safe to drop the bucket and tinderbox.\n\n====Iban's blood====\n'''''Items required:''' [[Food]], [[combat]] [[equipment]], and the [[doll of Iban]].''\n\nHead straight north from the tomb, and keep going until you reach a corridor full of [[blessed spider]]s. Walk inside until you find a giant level 89 spider named [[Kalrag]]. Kalrag can hit somewhat hard (at least 9), but is very inaccurate. The biggest challenge with this boss fight is fighting Kalrag alone. Kill him, it may take many tries to get the spiders off of you if you are below 79 combat.\n[[File:Underground Pass - fighting Kalrag.png|thumb|230px|A player uses a skeleton as a safespot to attack Kalrag.]]\nWhen you defeat him, you'll automatically soak up the blood with your [[Doll of iban|doll]]. '''The spiders nearby will attack you and can pile up on you despite not being a [[multi-combat area]]. They will interrupt the fight with Kalrag if they are attacking you. Once you kill Kalrag, you will be [[Stun (status)|stunned]] for about two seconds (and can be attacked by all spiders at once) so heal up before dealing the finishing blow.''' While stunned, you will automatically smear Iban's blood onto the doll.\n\nLow levels might have a problem with Kalrag as the blessed spiders will keep attacking, preventing the player from attacking him. This can be avoided by running alongside Kalrag, killing blessed spiders in the hope that Kalrag will be the next to [[aggro]] on you. You can also try trapping Kalrag in the north-western corner of the cave, to make sure he's next to you after you kill a spider.\n\n====Iban's dove====\n'''''Items required:''' [[Klank's gauntlets]] and the [[doll of Iban]].''\nMake sure you put on [[Klank's gauntlets]]. From the entrance to the spider den where you fought Kalrag, head north-west to the far corner of the cave system. There's another staircase you can climb up to reach the upper area.\n\nNear you, there will be several cages with [[Soulless|half-soulless]] in them. Do not bother with the first batch of cages; skip the first set and instead continue a bit south. Make your way across the agility jump.\n\nWalk to the fourth cage from the start (from the first, walk east to the next, then search the cage just to the north-west), and search it for the dove bones.\n\nEventually, you will find the skeletal remains of [[Iban's dove]]. It could take a while, but when you find them, use them on the [[Doll of iban|doll]].\n:'''Note:''' If you're not wearing your gauntlets, the half-soulless will bite you and cause some damage.\n\n===Killing Iban===\n'''''Items required:''' [[Doll of Iban]].''\n\nNow, to finally destroy Iban and bring an end to this quest. You'll need to jump your way to Iban's temple in the center of the area.\n\nOnce you're there, kill a [[disciple of Iban]] and take his [[Zamorak robes]]. '''Make sure the robes are ''all'' you're wearing, and free up at least one inventory space for Iban's staff, and 2 more spaces for a tiny amount of fire and death runes. Note anything you drop to free up space WILL be lost here as you will be teleported back to the entrance room of the cave.'''\n\n'''(Should you die attempting to dispose of the doll, you will have to run through the entirety of the dungeon again, so be sure to bring the items required with you.)'''\n\nEnter the temple wearing both upper and lower Zamorak Robes.\n\nUse the [[Doll of iban|doll]] on the well in the center of the room. <u>You may have to do this a few times, as his attacks may interrupt you.</u> When you do manage to get the doll into the well, Iban will be destroyed and the temple will begin to collapse.\n\nYou will receive [[Iban's staff]], 15 [[Death rune]]s, and 30 [[Fire rune]]s. If you do not have space in your inventory for anything else, you will receive Iban's staff but lose the runes you would have gotten since you are immediately teleported after placing the doll in the well and have no chance to pick them up.\n\n'''Note:''''' A method to never get hit by Lord Iban's spell is to wait for the eight ticks he sends his spell and then walk in to his lair. Now, wait for the seventh spell to show, and then run to the well in the center of the room and use the doll.''\n\nYou'll be teleported to a cavern with [[Koftik]], who'll be sane again. Talk to him to be teleported right next to the entrance. Leave the cavern and return to [[Ardougne]], and tell [[King Lathas]] of your success to finish the quest. \n\n'''Congratulations! Quest complete!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Underground Pass\n|image = [[File:Underground Pass reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 5\n|rewards = *3,000 [[Agility]] experience\n*3,000 [[Attack]] experience\n*15 [[Death rune]]s\u00a0and 30 [[Fire rune]]s\n*[[Iban's staff]] and use of the [[Iban Blast]] spell.\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Underground Pass is required for the following:\n*[[Legends' Quest]]\n*[[Regicide]]\n*[[Freeing Sir Amik Varze]]\n\n==Trivia==\nPrior to being fixed, [[mithril seeds]] could be exploited to cross the grid puzzle effortlessly.

This is still possible; however, you can only place the seeds after stepping onto the first tile, so there is a chance of failure. Theoretically, it was also possible to burn logs to cross the grid in the same fashion; however, doing so would require too much inventory space to be effective.

He will talk about vampires and give you a [[stake]].\n\nNext, buy a [[hammer]] from a [[general store]] if you don't already have one. You can buy the hammer from the [[Varrock General Store]], which is just north of [[Blue Moon Inn]].

Ask if he has any jobs for you, and he lets you know that a clerk has made an error and that you're not actually permitted to be a [[Temple Knights|Temple Knight]]. It turns out you have to work as a squire for five years. This is too long, so Sir Tiffy offers an alternative by exploiting a loophole. He'll then ask you to go see [[Sir Amik Varze]] in the [[White Knights' Castle]].\n\n===Sir Amik Varze===\n:'''Note:''' If wearing [[Initiate armour]] during the chat with [[Sir Amik Varze]], the dialogue will be different, but you may still go through the quest without it.\n[[File:Sir Amik Varze chathead.png|left]]\nSir Amik Varze is on the {{FloorNumber|3}} on the west side in the [[White Knights' Castle]]\u00a0in [[Falador]]. ''He will ask you to become a squire after a small conversation. '''Decline his offer''', and the conversation will continue.'' If you do not decline his offer to become a squire, he will ask for [[Asgarnian ale]] in an endless loop. Speak to [[Sir Tiffy Cashien]] to undo this. It turns out that there needs to be a crisis for you to become a deputy, but there is no current crisis. Report back to Sir Tiffy in [[Falador Park]]. For some players, Sir Tiffy will not say anything about a crisis until you have spoken to him a few times. Eventually, Sir Tiffy will inform you of a crisis that has arisen. Head back to talk to Sir Amik again.\n\nAmik will tell you the news that a criminal named [[Solus Dellagar]], the \"infamous murder-mage,\" is back. Follow the very unclear conversation through to the end, and accept his mission.\n\n===The Communication Orb===\n''Items Needed: 10000 coins '''or '''1 law rune, 1 molten glass, and 1 enchanted gem''\n[[File:Savant chathead.png|left]]\nOnce again, go back to [[Sir Tiffy Cashien]]. It turns out you're just the \"agent\" that needs to locate [[Solus Dellagar]]. As an agent, you need to be in constant communication. Sir Tiffy offers you a communication device for 10,000 [[coins]], or he can make one if you bring the supplies. Give Sir Tiffy the money or the supplies (a [[law rune]], an [[enchanted gem]] and [[molten glass]]). Either way, you'll receive a [[Commorb]] from him. It is needed for the whole quest.\n\nUse the \"contact\" feature on the orb to talk to [[Savant]]. It turns out that you should investigate the [[Black Knights' Base|Black Knight Hideout]] in [[Taverley Dungeon]], and investigate the [[Mage of Zamorak]] in [[Varrock]] that is interested in\u00a0[[Runecrafting]] (this is where you will need your 20 pure essence).\n\nIf you lose your [[Commorb|orb]] after you make one, [[Sir Tiffy Cashien]] will lend you his.\n\n===Taverley Dungeon===\n''Items needed: Combat [[equipment]] to kill [[Black Knight]]s''\n{{Main|Taverley Dungeon}}\n[[File:Taverley Dungeon location.png|thumb|left|200px|The [[Taverley Dungeon|dungeon]] location, south of [[Taverley]].]]\nNext, head over to the [[Taverley Dungeon]]. From the west [[bank]] in [[Falador]], you can use the [[Agility]] [[shortcut]] (level 5 Agility required), and keep heading northwest towards [[Taverley]] until you see a ladder. Use the ladder and follow the dungeon north, then east, then south past the [[magic axe]]s, [[Poison Scorpion]]s, [[chaos dwarves]] (do not cross the bridge), and finally past the [[Hill Giant]]s, and into the [[Black Knight]]s' rooms.\n[[File:Wanted! - Solus meets with Lord Daquarius.png|thumb|220px|Solus meets with [[Lord Daquarius]].]]\nContinue through the double doors, and talk to [[Lord Daquarius]] in the southwesternmost room. He tells you nothing. [[Savant]] will call you. (Use the '''contact''' option on the [[Commorb]] if she doesn't call automatically.) She advises you to try to bluff him into giving you something. Go kill a level 33 [[Black Knight]] to make Lord Daquarius give in and beg you not to kill any more of his men. He tells you that [[Solus Dellagar]] is in a place with a lot of [[fur]], but that the fur is not from a [[bear]].\n:'''Note:''' The Black Knight kill won't count if you kill it before talking to Lord Daquarius, if you leave the room after the kill, or if you get interrupted during the ensuing conversation.\n\n===Zamorak Mage===\n''Items needed: 20 unnoted [[Rune essence|rune]]/[[pure essence]], Commorb''[[File:Varrock Chaos Altar Location.png|thumb|left|200px|Location of Chaos Altar in Varrock]]\n'''NOTE:''' Do not equip any Saradomin or Guthix items (such as [[Void Knight equipment]]) or the Zamorak Mage will refuse to speak with you. In addition, if you have talked to the Zamorak Mage within the wilderness prior you can go straight to the [[Chaos Altar]] in Varrock.\n\nHead to [[Edgeville]] (or directly to the Chaos Altar if you have already done the Abyss miniquest) and grab 20 unnoted [[Rune essence|rune]]/[[pure essence]] from the bank. Follow the river into the [[Wilderness]] where the [[Mage of Zamorak]] will be at the end of the river, and he will then tell you to meet him \"somewhere\" in [[Varrock]], which is the Chaos Altar in the temple in South East Varrock.\n[[File:Wanted! - Solus confronts Mage of Zamorak.png|thumb|220px|Solus meets with the Zamorakian [[Mage of Zamorak|mage]].]]\nTalk to him about [[Solus Dellagar]], and make sure you do not wear anything of [[Guthix]] or [[Saradomin]] (including Void). The Zamorak Mage wants your [[Commorb|orb]] in return for information, but [[Savant]] explains that it would be useless to him. He offers to trade his information for 20 rune essence instead. Talk to him again with the unnoted essence. The mage gives your character the tip that Solus went east. Your character connects \"east\" with the previous tip, \"fur,\" and realises that Solus must be in [[Canifis]] with the [[Werewolf|werewolves]].\n\n===Canifis===\nEither run to [[Canifis]] or, if you have completed [[Ghosts Ahoy]], grab your [[Ectophial]] from the bank to teleport there. Alternatively, you teleport to the [[Slayer Tower]] using a [[Slayer ring]] and run south, or use the [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|cks}} to get nearby.\n[[File:Wanted! - encountering Solus.png|thumb|220px|The player encounters Solus for the first time.]]\nOnce in Canifis, [[Savant]] will call you and tell you in a lengthy conversation that Solus is probably using a unique \"slow teleport\", which makes him invisible. If you accidentally keep running and skip the conversation with Savant, step outside the town back to the fairy ring and the conversation will trigger again. Now, use the \"scan\" option on your [[Commorb]] as you walk around the town until you uncover [[Solus Dellagar]]. Solus briefly appears, speaks with you, and disappears.\n\n=== Chasing Solus ===\nSavant then calls and finds that she is able to pull items off of Solus as he escapes. These items give you a clue as to Solus' next whereabouts. From this point on, you'll be chasing Solus throughout ''[[RuneScape]]'', and each time you find him, you'll receive an item. That item is a hint for where to go next. These items are always random, so here's a list of items that you may receive, along with where you should go:\n[[File:Wanted! - Solus disguised.png|thumb|220px|Solus disguises himself as a woman to distract the player.]]\n*[[Banana]] - [[Musa Point]] [[banana plantation]]\n*[[Bear fur]] - [[Ardougne Market]]\n*[[Beer]] - [[Dragon Inn]] in [[Yanille]] ([[fairy ring]] - {{Fairycode|ciq}})\n*[[Blue wizard hat]] - [[Wizards' Tower]] south of [[Draynor Village]], ground floor library.

Depending on your [[Hitpoints]] level, it will do up to 96 damage. It won't kill you, and [[Savant]] will teleport you back to [[Falador]], in the [[White Knights' Castle]] without losing anything.\n\nAfter a few locations, make sure to have a [[Weapons|weapon]] and [[armour]]. At the second-to-last location (the one before the [[Rune essence mine]]), Solus will summon a level 32 [[Black Knight]] to take you out. Kill it.\n[[File:Wanted! - Solus decimates rangers.png|thumb|220px|[[Solus Dellagar]]'s powerful [[Ice Barrage]] attack.]]\nYour last clue will be 20 noted [[Pure essence|pure]]/[[rune essence]]. Bank and equip a weapon and armour for the final fight. Use any rune essence teleport spot you want, and [[Savant]] will close off possible teleports in order to trap him. After a small cutscene, Savant will summon 15 rangers to assist you, but Solus kills them all with [[Ice Barrage]].\n[[File:Wanted! - Fighting Solus.png|thumb|220px|The final battle.]]\nGo attack Solus yourself and kill him,\u00a0and you'll get his [[Solus's hat|hat]]. He's fairly easy as he has been weakened after using such a powerful attack on the Temple Knight rangers.. He has no specific [[Combat level]], has 40 [[Hitpoints]] and only uses melee. After the fight, Savant congratulates you. You are returned to the rune essence teleport location. If you lose Solus's hat, contact Savant for another one.\n\n===Finishing===\nReturn to [[Falador]]. Talk to [[Sir Amik Varze]] in the [[White Knights' Castle]], and hand over the hat.\n\n'''Congratulations! Quest complete!'''\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>He'll explain to you about the [[White equipment|new armour]] system and killing [[Black Knight]]s (and [[White Knight]]s).\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Wanted!\n|image = [[File:Wanted! reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 1\n|rewards = \n*{{Skill clickpic|Slayer|5,000}} [[Slayer]] [[experience]]\n*Access to the armoury of the [[White Knight]]s ([[White equipment]])\n}}\n\n==Required for completing==\nCompletion of Wanted! is required for the following:\n* [[The Slug Menace]]\n* [[Devious Minds]]\n\n==Trivia==\n*If you are wearing [[Initiate armour]] when you talk to [[Sir Amik Varze]] about quitting the [[Temple Knights]], he will point it out and your character will boast about getting to keep \"the cool armour\".\n*The quote \"Dead or Alive, You're coming with me\" that your character says before being blasted by Solus' spell, is likely a reference to the film 'RoboCop'\n*<nowiki>Before spawning a Black Knight to fight you, Solus quotes: ''Say hello to my little friend!'', a reference to the film 'Scarface'</nowiki>\n*When you get the bone spear as one of your teleport items, Savant used to say \"I have never heard of them\" when you mention the Dorgeshuun goblins. This references the quest \"The Lost Tribe\" because the goblins had been in hiding since the God Wars. After the September 2017 update, Savant will instead ask the player if they have ever heard of \"a group of goblins that have been around since Fossil Island was abandoned\".\n*When you get the bone spear the player will speak as if they know of the Dorgeshuun goblins even if you have not started \"The Lost Tribe\" quest.\n\n==Knight Rankings==\nIn order to increase your ranking, you must kill a certain number of [[Black Knight]]s.

He will explain that the Watchtower is not working, because the spell created does not keep out [[ogres]]. He tells you that the [[Crystal (Watchtower)|crystals]] that make the spell have been stolen! After starting, you will be asked to search the grounds of the Watchtower. You can now use the tower's main ladder, but using the trellis avoids a conversation with the guard and gives you 31 [[Agility]] [[experience]] each time. Search the '''far northwest''' bush for some\u00a0[[fingernails]]. You'll find some other things in other bushes ([[old robe]], [[unusual armour]], [[damaged dagger]], [[tattered eye patch]]) but you only need to search until you find the fingernails. Go back to the Watchtower wizard, and show him the fingernails. You can drop the remaining items, as they have no value.\n[[File:Searching the bushes.png|thumb|220px|Searching the bushes near the Watchtower.]]\nThe wizard will tell you that the fingernails belong to [[Skavid]]s, the servants of the ogres, and that they have stolen the four [[Crystal (Watchtower)|power crystals]] that protect the city from ogres. Your job is to recover the crystals.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is gain access to the city. In order to enter, you'll need to help out three [[Ogre chieftain|ogre tribe chieftains]] to get pieces of an [[ogre relic]]. This can then be given to the gate guards to prove that you're a friend to the ogres.\n[[File:Watchtower map guide.png|thumb|centre|500px|All the important locations throughout the quest.]]\n\n===Og===\n''Note: The Ogres near all three camps are non-aggressive.''[[File:Og location.png|thumb|220px|Og's location.]]\nFirst, go through the city of [[Yanille]] using the [[agility shortcut]] or the east entrance. Stop at the bank to grab your [[armour]], [[food]], two [[rope]]s, and one set of [[dragon bones]] if you haven't already. Head out the west gate and turn northwest to find a tribe of ogres. Note that, as a general rule of thumb, any ogre that wields a [[mace]] is [[non-aggressive]]. Talk to [[Og]] to learn that his nemesis, [[Toban]], stole a [[Toban's gold|bar of gold]] from him. Your job is to get it back. Og will give you a [[Toban's key|key]] to Toban's chest. Keep this key with you for later.\n\n===Grew===\n[[File:Grew location.png|thumb|220px|Grew's location.]]\nHead south of [[Og]]'s tribe. You should see an island with an ogre tribe on it and some [[jangerberries]]. Find the long-branched tree on the west shore. Use one [[rope]] on the branch of the tree (not the tree itself) to swing to the island. Note that you will lose the rope. Take some jangerberries because you'll need them later in the quest. Talk to [[Grew]]. Grew will tell you to teach his enemy, [[Gorad]], a lesson by knocking one of his [[Ogre tooth|teeth]] out (make sure that you have room in your inventory for this tooth, or you will have to kill him again).\n\n===Toban, and Gorad's tooth===\nThe next stop is a third tribe of ogres. Leave the island using the tree with the rope swing on the north side. Head southeast then go around [[Gu'Tanoth]] headed east. You will see a broken bridge leading to a small island. The next tribe you will need to meet is on that island, but the bridge is out so you will need to find another way across. Keep going a little bit south of the bridge, then turn west and continue along the southern edge of Gu'tanoth until you reach a hole surrounded by rocks. Pick up the death rune a ways south of this hole if you need it. ''The hole is west-northwest of the [[Gnome Glider|gnome glider]]. ''(See map above).\n\nEnter the hole to reach an island with [[Toban]]'s tribe on it. South of the ladder, you should find a level 68 chieftain called [[Gorad]]. Talk to him and tell him that you have come to knock his teeth out. He will attack you. Kill him to get a [[Ogre tooth|tooth]]. Keep the tooth for later.\n\nNext, speak to Toban. He will ask you to give him the bones of a dragon to chew on. Give him your [[dragon bones]]. '''<u>Make sure not to bury them!</u>''' Toban will give you the [[Relic part 3|third piece]] of the [[Ogre relic|relic]] in return.\n\nOpen Toban's chest on the island, and you will find [[Og]]'s [[Toban's gold|stolen gold]].\n\nA [[rope]] spawns on the island if you don't already have one for travelling back to [[Grew]]'s island.\n\n===Completing the relic===\n[[File:Combining relic parts.gif|frame|The Watchtower Wizard combines the three relic parts.]]\nLeave the island via the ladder. Make your way around the west side of the ogre city or teleport by either walking or using a [[Ring of dueling]] or [[Minigame Group Finder]] teleport to [[Castle Wars]] and walk back to [[Grew]]'s island (with the [[jangerberries]]). Use your second [[rope]] on the tree. Talk to Grew to give him [[Gorad|Gorad's]] [[Ogre tooth|tooth]]. You will receive another [[Relic part 2|piece of the relic]] in return for your deed. He will also give you the first [[Crystal (quest item)|crystal]]! Keep this for later. '''If you don't have jangerberries yet, pick some from the island <u>before you leave</u>.''' Then, leave the island using the rope swing and head north back to [[Og]]. Talk to him to give him his stolen [[Toban's gold|gold bar]]. You will receive the final [[Relic part 1|piece of the relic]].\n\nOnce you have all three parts of the relic, take them to the [[Watchtower wizard]] to get them assembled. Head through [[Yanille]], and use the [[agility shortcut]] if possible. While at the Watchtower, pick up a [[candle]] at the spawn on the ground level if you need a [[light source]]. Stop at the bank to pick up a '''[[tinderbox]]''', '''[[light source]]''', '''[[anti-dragon shield]]''', '''[[death rune]],'''  20 coins ''(27 coins if you need to buy a [[pestle and mortar]] and a [[vial]])'', and  a '''[[gold bar]].''' You can '''deposit the crystal''' for safe keeping.\n\n===Access to Gu'Tanoth===\n'''''Items needed:'''\u00a020\u00a0[[coins]] (27 coins if you need to buy a [[pestle and mortar]] and [[vial]]), [[anti-dragon shield]], a\u00a0[[death rune]], and the [[Ogre relic]]. Bring your [[gold bar]], [[tinderbox]], and [[light source]] as well to save a bank trip.''\n\nAfter you have the full relic, head back through [[Yanille]] and out the west gate. Head southeast until you see a path leading up into [[Gu'Tanoth]]. Go south and follow the path up the hill. At the split, take the northwest trail to the [[Ogre guard]]s. Use your Ogre Relic on one of them to gain access to the city\u2014'''do not talk to them''', or else they will just knock you back down the hill.\n\nOnce you're inside the city, go east and then south to the market. The ogres aren't aggressive, but watch out for the [[Ogre trader]]s, who will attack if spoken to. There is also a non-aggressive merchant named [[Ogre merchant|Grud]] (labelled Ogre merchant) who will sell you [[Herblore]] supplies. Buy a pestle and mortar and vial (7 coins total) from him for later use if you do not already have them in your inventory. Find the southern stall in the market with food (grey cylinders) on it, and then steal a [[rock cake]]. Be careful with the cake as the left-click option eats it, dealing damage and forcing you to go steal another.\n\nGo back on the main path to the west and follow it south. You'll find two more guards. Talk to one. '''Be careful of what you say, '''the guard will knock you out of the area if you mess up. They will ask for some food from the market. '''Do not eat the rock cake!''' Give them your rock cake to get by. Then, continue on until you find a broken bridge. Attempt to jump the gap in the bridge. (Find the \"attempt to jump\" by clicking on your side of the gap for a red X option). The guards will ask for money, so pay them 20gp to cross the gap. Grab the knife here if you need a slash weapon, you will need it later for webs.\n[[File:Watchtower Skavid.png|thumb|220px|The guards who give you the [[Skavid map]].]]\nPass the aggressive ogre and you will find several city guards. If you talk to them, they'll give you a word puzzle. The answer to the puzzle is \"''death rune''\". Give the guard the death rune you grabbed earlier and he will give you a map of the [[Skavid Caves]].\n:'''Note:''' One of the medium tasks in the [[Ardougne achievement diary]] requires you to have a [[Skavid map]]. If you ever plan on doing these tasks, you should keep the map so that you don't have to come back here to get another.\n\n===Skavid caves===\n'''''Items needed:'''\u00a0[[Skavid map]], a\u00a0[[light source]]\u00a0and a\u00a0[[gold bar]].''\n[[File:A skavid is silenced.png|thumb|220px|A skavid is silenced while speaking to the player.]]\nThe [[Skavid Caves]] are a series of caves located beneath the ogre city. Their entrances are scattered around the north and east sides of the city. You need the [[Skavid map]] and a [[light source]] to get in. Their locations are:\n*(Scared Skavid) East of Gu'Tanoth along the southeast branch of the entrance path to the city\n*Northeast of Gu'Tanoth along the main entrance path to the city\n*North of Gu'Tanoth near the opening of the main entrance path to the city\n*North of Gu'Tanoth south of the west gate to [[Yanille]] \n*East of Gu'Tanoth outside the city around the east side of the mountain\n\nYou can also refer to the map above to find the cave entrances.\n\nYou will need to enter all of the caves until you find the [[Scared skavid]], who will teach you some basic Skavid words. Then, go to the other four caves and talk to each (regular) [[Skavid]], trying each word until it says that they understood you, and then move on to the next cave with the next Skavid.\n\nReturn to the [[Scared skavid]]. It will tell you that you're ready to take on the [[Mad skavid]].\n\nGo past the Skavid caves along the southeast path of the entrance to the Ogre City and '''use the gold bar on one of the guards''' to gain access. Go south and west across the bridge and enter the cave. Talk to the mad skavid and respond with the language you just learned.\n:If he says \"''Ar cur''\", the correct response is \"''Gor''\".\n:If he says \"''Bidith ig''\", the correct response is \"''Cur''\".\n:If he says \"''Gor nod''\", the correct response is \"''Tanath''\".\n:If he says \"''Cur tanath''\", the correct response is \"''Bidith''\".\n:If he says \"''Bidith tanath''\", the correct response is \"''Cur''\".\n:If he says \"''Tanath gor''\", the correct response is \"''Nod''\".\n:If he says \"''Cur bidith''\", the correct response is \"''Ig''\".\n:If he says \"''Gor cur''\", the correct response is \"''Ar''\".\n\nIf you respond correctly, the Skavid will give you a [[Crystal (Watchtower)|crystal]]. Take two\u00a0[[cave nightshade]]s at the spawn inside. '''Do NOT''' eat the nightshade as it will cause damage to you. You can enter and exit the cave in order for the nightshade to respawn faster. The hole in the corner will take you back to [[Yanille]].\n\n===The Ogre Enclave===\n'''''Items needed:'''\u00a0[[Anti-dragon shield]], [[food]] and 2 [[cave nightshade]]s.''\n[[File:Shaman kills dragon.gif|frame|The Ogre shaman deals a powerful hit to a Blue dragon.]]\nMake sure you have your [[anti-dragon shield]] equipped. Go back to the [[Gu'Tanoth]] marketplace (just west of where you stole the [[rock cake]]) and use one of your [[nightshade]]s on an enclave guard to distract them. '''Make sure you complete the dialogue by using the spacebar or pressing 'Click here' to continue, or else you will have to get another cave nightshade.''' After continuing the dialogue, you will automatically enter the [[Ogre Enclave]]. You'll see a short cutscene with an [[Ogre shaman]] and a [[Blue dragon]].\u00a0'''Do not attack or talk to the shamans, or you will instantly lose 20 [[Hitpoints]].''' The last two [[Crystal (Watchtower)|crystals]] are here, but you can't get them without some help. Run past the blue dragons and out the exit at the north end. You will appear outside one of the northern [[Skavid caves]].\n\n===Magic ogre potion===\n'''''Items needed:'''\u00a0An empty or water-filled [[vial]], [[guam leaf]], [[pestle and mortar]], [[jangerberries]], and [[bat bones]].''\n\nHead north into [[Yanille]]. Stop at the bank to grab a vial (with or without water), a guam leaf, a pestle and mortar, jangerberries, and bat bones if you have them.\n\nHead back toward the [[Watchtower (building)|Watchtower]]. If you need bat bones, a little east of the Watchtower, you'll find a house whose entrance is covered in webs. Take a [[slash weapon|slashing weapon]] or a [[knife]], cut through the web and enter the building. You will find several [[giant bat]]s. Kill one and take its bones.\n\nReturn to the Watchtower. If your vial is empty, fill it at the fountain outside. Climb the ladders and talk to the [[Watchtower wizard]]. He will tell you that you can make a potion to destroy the [[ogre shaman]]. '''You must add the ingredients in this order:'''\n#Add a [[guam leaf]] to a [[vial of water]].\n#Add some [[jangerberries]]. '''Be careful because the left-click option is to eat.''' If accidentally eaten, they respawn on [[Grew]]'s island - you'll need another [[rope]].\n#Use your [[pestle and mortar]] on the [[bat bones]] to grind them. Add the [[ground bat bones]] to the vial mixture.\n#Give the mixture to the [[Watchtower wizard]] to get it enchanted, turning it into [[magic ogre potion]].\n\n===Shaman slaying===\n'''''Items needed:'''\u00a0Some [[food]], [[Anti-dragon shield]], a [[pickaxe]], [[cave nightshade]] and the [[magic ogre potion]].''\n[[File:Killing ogre shaman.gif|right|frame|Using the magic ogre potion to kill the ogre shamans.]]\nReturn to the [[Yanille]] bank to prepare for the [[blue dragon]] and shaman enclave. Bring your pickaxe, an anti-dragonfire shield, cave nightshade and some food. Now, go back to the market place in [[Gu'Tanoth]]. Distract the cave guards using your second nightshade, and enter the cave. Again, you must complete the dialogue by using the spacebar or pressing ''click here'' to continue, or else you will have to get another cave nightshade.\nRun around the cave and use the [[magic ogre potion]] on each of the six [[Ogre shaman]]s while avoiding the blue dragons as much as possible. The potion will instantly kill the shamans and you won't take any damage. The last shaman you kill will drop the [[Crystal (Watchtower)|blue crystal]], which is automatically put into your inventory.\n\n[[File:Crystal mining.png|thumb|left|220px|Mining the final crystal.]]\nIf you somehow lose the blue crystal, there is a [[Shaman robe]] in the southeast corner, amongst some bones where you can pick it up and search it for the crystal.\n\nTo get the last [[Crystal (Watchtower)|crystal]], find the Rock of Dalgroth in the [[Ogre Enclave]] in the centre of the Enclave and mine it with your pickaxe. '''This is in the cave with the blue dragons.''' Mine the rock before leaving the cave, otherwise you will need to get nightshades again.\n\n===Reviving the Watchtower===\n'''''Items needed:'''\u00a0All 4 [[Crystal (Watchtower)|crystals]].''\n[[File:Watchtower crystals alignment.png|thumb|228x228px|The correct crystal positioning.]]\nLeave the [[Ogre Enclave|enclave]] using the far north exit again (or use a [[Nightmare Zone]] [[minigame teleport]]). Grab the yellow crystal if you banked it earlier, and take all four crystals back to the [[Watchtower (building)|Watchtower]]. Talk to the [[Watchtower wizard]], and he will ask you to fix the machine for him.\n\nThe crystals must be placed in these places:\n*'''Yellow''' crystal in the '''southwest''' pillar\n*'''Grey''' crystal in the '''southeast''' pillar\n*'''Cyan''' crystal in the '''northwest''' pillar\n*'''Magenta''' crystal in the '''northeast''' pillar\n\nFinally, pull the lever on the west side of the room to complete the quest.\n\n==Rewards==\n{{Quest rewards\n|name = Watchtower\n|image = [[File:Watchtower reward scroll.png|centre]]\n|qp = 4\n|rewards = \n*{{Skill clickpic|Magic|15,250}} [[Magic]] [[experience]]\n*5,000 [[Coins]]\n*A scroll, the reading of which gives you the ability to use [[Watchtower Teleport]]\n*Access to the ogre city (and [[Ogre Enclave]] where you can fight [[blue dragon]]s.

Exit Almera's house toward the river and board the Log raft; you will crash into a small island.\n\nYour character will tell Hudon to come back to his mother, but he refuses and says that there is much treasure to be found. When you ask if you can help, he rejects you, saying you will steal the treasure.\n\nGo to the south end of the small island, and use your [[rope]] on the rock in the distance. The rock you want is at the far south, you may have to pan your camera down in order to see it. Next, use your rope on the dead tree to get to a cliff edge alongside the waterfall.\n\nClick on the barrel to get down safely instead of taking damage.\n\nIf you didn't bring a rope, you can attempt to swim in the river and you will be washed down to near where the barrel normally takes you.\n\nYou should end up near a large building with a fisherman outside of it. Inside the building, speak to [[Hadley]] and run through all of the options. This is the tourist information centre; go upstairs and search the bookcases to find a book named [[book on baxtorian]].\n:'''Note:''' You must open this book or the key will not appear for the next part.\n\nYou will discover that they were Elven people and there is a legend about treasure hidden under the falls.

If you can, talk to [[Elkoy]], and follow him to the village entrance. If you have not begun [[Tree Gnome Village]] you will have to navigate through the maze. It is highly encouraged that you start this quest by talking to [[King Bolren]] as soon as possible. The minigame teleport to Fishing Trawler will put you to the east of the maze.\n\nYou should find a ladder in the hedge maze. This is where you're going to find the pebble. Climb down. Very low level players should exercise caution due to the [[hobgoblin]]s within. First, obtain [[A key (Tree Gnome Village dungeon)|the key]] in the east room. The key is found in the two crates stacked on top of each other in the south-east corner; they are colored differently from the rest of the crates. Next, you will find a gnome called [[Golrie]] locked in the west room, hiding from the hobgoblins. Use your key on the door, then speak to the gnome to receive [[Glarial's pebble]].\n:'''Note:''' Glarial's pebble is needed for the followup quest [[Roving Elves]]. If you plan to complete this later, you can save some time by keeping the pebble after this quest. You can also acquire multiple pebbles by dropping the pebble, and talking to Golrie again. This is strongly advised for lower level players in case you die on the next step.\n\n:'''Quick exit:''' Start the [[Tree Gnome Village]] quest by talking to [[King Bolren]] in the center of the maze.

Now, put all of your [[weapons]], [[armour]], [[runes]] and [[arrows]] in the [[bank]] (bring decent food), as you won't be allowed to enter the tomb if you bring them. Also, remember to put one of the Glarial's pebble that you got into the bank in case you die. Go just south-east of [[Baxtorian Falls]] and just north-west of the [[Fishing Guild]] to find a tombstone. Use the pebble on it to enter, as it will not let you in with weapons, armour, or things used in [[combat]] such as runes or arrows.\n\nInside, there are high-level monsters \u2014 ignore them or attack a [[skeleton]] or [[Zombie (common)|zombie]] before continuing west to prevent the any [[Moss giant (Roving Elves)|moss giants]] attacking you, as they have a max hit of 14. Doing so is strongly advised for low-level players. Run to the west part of the cave, past the level 84 moss giants, and search the chest to get [[Glarial's amulet]].\u00a0Head to the south part of the cave and search the coffin to get [[Glarial's urn]].\n\n[[File:Waterfall Quest glarial's tomb.png|thumb|200px|Glarial's Tomb containing her urn.]]\nAfter searching the chest and coffin,\u00a0exit the tomb by going up the ladder. If you're low-leveled you may want to acquire multiple amulets and urns. To get an extra amulet, drop it and search the chest and pick it up again.

Use [[Glarial's amulet]] on the Statue of Glarial, and then use [[Glarial's urn]] on the Chalice of Eternity. Take the reward (note that you must have five free slots to accept it) from the chalice after the ground rises up to it to finish! Be careful, if you forget to put the urn on the Chalice of Eternity, you will be flushed out of the room!\n:'''Note:''' If you do get flushed out, the pillars will remain active and you will not need another amulet for the statue.

He will give you [[an empty folder]] to keep them in.\n\nThe outlaws are located south of the [[fairy ring]] (code {{Fairycode|DKR}} if you've started [[Fairytale II - Cure a Queen]]), west of the [[Grand Exchange]]; from the Grand Exchange, you can use the [[shortcut]] (requires 21 [[Agility]]) to get to the location of the outlaws more easily; Use an\u00a0[[Amulet of Glory]]\u00a0to teleport to Edgeville crossing the east bridge and heading south.\n\nOnce at the [[Outlaw Camp|camp]], kill five [[outlaw]]s (level 32) to retrieve five of [[Rat's paper]]s, and then use them on the folder to get a [[full folder]].\n[[File:What Lies Below - fighting outlaws.png|thumb|220px|Fighting the outlaws in their camp.]]\nReturn to Rat with the folder, and he will ask you to deliver [[Letter to Surok]] to [[Surok Magis]] in the library of [[Varrock Palace]].\n\nHead to the library, on the north side of the ground floor of the castle, and speak to Surok Magis. He will destroy the letter and tell you that he can turn plain [[clay]] into [[gold bar]]s! He will need two items, an ordinary [[bowl]] and an [[infused wand]]. He will give you [[Sin'keth's diary]] and a [[Wand (What Lies Below)|wand]] to be infused with chaos.\n\nIf you want to get kudos and a magic lamp from the Varrock museum you'll need to get the book [[Dagon'hai History]]. You'll find it in one of the two bookcases furthest east. After the quest you can give the book to the [[Historian Minas]] on the {{FloorNumber|2}} of the Varrock museum.\n\n===Chaos altar===\nNow, you have to go to the [[Chaos altar]]. This requires either a [[chaos talisman]], [[chaos tiara]], or access to the [[Abyss]]. Also, do not forget to bring the required 15 [[chaos rune]]s to use with the altar.\n\n====Option 1====\nHead to the [[Chaos altar]] entrance in the [[Wilderness]], and once inside, make your way through the maze to the Chaos altar. This can take some time as the maze can get frustrating, and walking into the Wilderness to get to the altar can also be dangerous. Once in, use the wand on the Altar.\n[[File:Infusing wand.gif|thumb|150px|Infusing the wand.]]\n====Option\u00a02====\nRead the [[Sin'keth's diary]], and then go east of [[Varrock]]. Go south-west of the [[Lumberyard]] and west of the [[Earth altar]]. You should find a statue of [[Saradomin]]. Talk to [[Anna Jones]], and she will give you a [[bronze pickaxe]]. You must use a bronze pickaxe to excavate the statue to reveal the [[Tunnel of Chaos]] entrance. Enter the tunnel, and you will find that [[Dagon'hai]] organisation lives there. Head north until you reach a portal. The portal leads to the second level of the Chaos Maze. Head west to the ladder that you can climb down. Lastly, walk east to reach the altar.\n\n====Option\u00a03====\nIf you have completed the [[Enter the Abyss]] [[miniquest]], then you can travel straight to the [[Chaos altar]] via teleporting from the [[Mage of Zamorak]] north of [[Edgeville]]\u00a0to the Abyss and entering the chaos rift.\n\n====Wand====\nUse your [[Wand (What Lies Below)|wand]] on the altar, and it will absorb the 15 [[chaos rune]]s and turn to the [[Infused wand]]. Now, return to the library of [[Varrock]], and talk to [[Surok Magis]] with the infused wand and bowl. He will then give you [[Surok's letter]] for [[Rat Burgiss|Rat]].\n\n===Ending===\nHead back to [[Rat Burgiss|Rat]], and deliver the [[Surok's letter|letter]]. Rat will explain to you that he is actually the commander of [[Varrock Palace Secret Guard]] and that [[Surok Magis]] is planning on taking over the Kingdom of [[Misthalin]] by using a mind-control spell on [[King Roald]]. Rat will direct you to [[Zaff]], owner of the [[Zaff's Superior Staffs!|staff shop]] in [[Varrock]], in order to prepare a spell to counteract Surok's.\n{{Listen\n|title = Surok's Theme\n|align = right\n|filename = Surok's Theme.ogg\n|desc = The music track that only plays during the confrontation with Surok.}}\nTalk to Zaff, and he will explain his plan to you. Zaff will give you a [[Beacon ring]] and [[Zaff's instructions]] on how to arrest Surok Magis. Get your gear ready for a fight.\nHead to Surok Magis (who is now wearing\u00a0[[Dagon'hai]] robes), and talk to him.\u00a0He will cast his spell on [[King Roald]], and you will have to fight him. Fight King Roald (level 47) until he is at 1 [[Hitpoint]], and then operate the Beacon ring (You do not need to be wearing the ring to operate it).\n\nZaff will arrive and will save King Roald by teleporting him away. Zaff then casts a spell on Surok Magis that seals him in the library from now on. He is now contained to the library forever. Zaff then casts another spell and the library goes dark. When the light comes back, evidence of the battle is cleaned up and Zaff is gone. '''After this occurs, you will be able to purchase battlestaves from [[Zaff's Superior Staffs!]]'''\n<gallery>\nWhat Lies Below - Fighting King Roald.png|The player fights King Roald\nWhat Lies Below - King Roald restored.png|Zaff casts a spell upon his arrival, restoring the King's mind.\nWhat Lies Below - Surok teleblocked.png|Surok attempts to escape, and is stopped by Zaff.\n</gallery>\nReturn to [[Rat Burgiss]] to finish the [[quest]].

(The quote originated from earlier in the same film where Captain Barbosa laid siege to the port and takes Elizabeth captive. She reveals that she has the gold piece and that she will give up the piece for the salvation of the port, preventing its destruction. However she forgets to bargain her own safety and return to shore and so upon asking the captain to return her to shore, he says, \"I'm somewhat disinclined to acquiesce to the request... It means no.\" and all the pirates on the ship laugh.)\n* If you have completed the [[Garden of Tranquility]] quest, while fighting [[King Roald]], he will shout phrases like \"I'm allergic to roses!\" and \"That garden was awful!\", which is a reference to the quest. If [[Shield of Arrav]] is completed, he will also say, \"A member of the Phoenix Gang?\"\n* After returning to Rat Burgiss with the full folder, he'll ask you to speak to Surok; your character will say, \"All work and no pay makes (username) a dull adventurer,\" which is a reference to {{wp|The Shining (film)|The Shining}}.\n\n{{What Lies Below}}\n[[Category:Quests]]\n[[Category:Varrock]]"], "Witch's House": ["{{External|rs|rsc}}\n{{Has quick guide}}\n{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Witch's House\n|image = [[File:Witch's House.png|300px]]\n|number = 20\n|members = Yes\n|release = 27 February [[2002]]\n|update = Latest RuneScape News (27 February 2002)\n|series = None\n|difficulty = Intermediate\n|developer = Paul Gower\n}}\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Talk to the [[boy]] near the gate entrance of [[Taverley]].\n|difficulty = Intermediate\n|description = A young boy who lives in Taverley has kicked his ball into the garden of a scary old lady.\n\nHe asks you to get it back for him.

He'll say he kicked his [[ball]] over the hedge and into the garden. He says the [[Nora T. Hagg|witch]] living in the house has taken the ball and put it in the shed. The boy wants you to get it back for him. Tell him you'll see what you can do.{{Clear}}\n\n===Breaking in===\n[[File:Witch's House - Breaking in.png|thumb|220px|The location of the [[Door key (Witch's House)|key]].]]\nMake your way around the hedge to come to the door of the house - you'll find it is locked. Search the pot north of the door to find a [[Door key (Witch's House)|door key]], and enter the house. Go inside; then, take the [[Diary (Witch's House)|diary]] on the table. Read all of it.\n\n===Getting to the garden===\nNow, take the ladder in the room to the north into the basement. If you don't already have leather gloves, search the boxes. It may take a few dozen tries. While wearing your [[leather gloves]], go through the gate and search the cupboard for the [[Magnet (Witch's House)|magnet]] (be sure to finish the dialogue). Then, go back up the ladder and into the little room with the door that leads to garden and drop your [[cheese]]. Suddenly, a mouse will come out; use the magnet on the mouse, and it will unlock the door. '''Be quick, the mouse will go away after a while ''and you will lose your cheese and have to get another one.''''' After you attach the magnet to the mouse, enter the door into the garden.\n\n===Getting past the witch===\nOnce you are in the garden, you will see the [[Nora T. Hagg|witch]] walking up and down the middle. Make your way all the way '''around the garden''' using the bushes as cover until you reach the fountain. \n\n'''''Do not'' cross the garden behind her back!''' She will turn around and teleport you outside of the garden, requiring you to use the [[Magnet (Witch's House)|magnet]] on the mouse again. Check the fountain and you will find the [[Key (Witch's House)|key]] to the shed.\n\n===Witch's experiment===\nMake your way to the shed and use the [[Key (Witch's House)|key]] on it. '''''Do not'' take the ball'''. If you do, your [[combat]] stats will be decreased. Attack the [[Witch's experiment]]. Each time you kill the experiment, it changes to a stronger form. You will have to kill the experiment a total of four times before it is eventually defeated - the first stage being a skavid (level 19), then a spider (level 30), then a bear (level 42), and finally, a wolf (level 53). If you flee during the battle, you will have to start again.\n[[File:Witch's House - Fighting the Witch's experiment.png|thumb|220px|Fighting the [[Witch's experiment]].]]\n'''For hitpoints pures or anyone else who only wants to use [[ring of recoil]]:''' They have 21, 31, 41, and 51 hitpoints respectively for a total of 144. This requires 4 rings of recoil, as each breaks after dealing 40 damage. You might want to bring an extra one for whatever reason. Their max hits also increase by 1 for each form. The skavid deals a max hit of 2, while the wolf deals up to 5. Bring lots of pineapple or anchovy pizza depending on your hitpoints level and purple sweets. If you don't want to tank them as much, bring a [[super poison]]ed [[bone dagger]] or super poisoned [[iron knives]] and attack until you see poison damage, then hide behind the table with the ball on it.\n\nIt is possible to [[safespot]] the third and fourth forms of the experiment by walking between the sacks and the crate with the [[ball]] on it all the way to the wall and using [[Ranged]] or [[Magic]] attacks to finish off the last two forms.\n\nOnce you have killed the experiment in all of its forms, take the ball and head out.

Try opening the coffin (it may take a couple of tries). When the coffin is open, search it to obtain a [[black prism]].\n*Backtrack and exit the cave by running back to the barricade or simply teleporting out.\n*'''Note:''' If you became diseased in the previous part, you can enter a dream in the [[Nightmare Zone]] in practice mode and leave to cure yourself. Alternatively, you can teleport to [[Clan Wars]] with a [[ring of dueling]], enter the [[Clan Wars#Free for all|Free-for-all]] portal and then leave to restore your stats.\n\n===B. Vahn===\n'''''Items required: '''[[Black prism]], [[Dragon inn tankard]], [[Torn page]], and 5 free inventory spaces.''\n*Proceed to [[Yanille]]. Using the [[Minigame teleport]] to the Nightmare Zone will place you next to Yanille. The [[Watchtower teleport]] can also be used to get to Yanille, assuming the [[Watchtower]] quest is completed. Fairy ring code {{Fairycode|ciq}} is also near Yanille.\n*Go to the [[Dragon Inn]], and use the [[Dragon inn tankard|tankard]] on the bartender. The bartender will explain that the tankard belonged to [[Brentle Vahn]], a not-so-moral customer who had been seen with a shady wizard.\n*Talk to [[Zavistic Rarve]] in the [[Wizards' Guild]]. If you don't have the required level to enter the guild, ring the front bell and Rarve will appear outside. After seeing the [[Black prism|prism]] and [[torn page]], Rarve will tell you to talk to [[Sithik Ints]] in the guest house north of the guild.\n\n===Incriminating Sithik===\nProceed to the guest house, which is directly north of the [[Magic Guild]], and then go to the top floor. [[Sithik]] is in the western most room (in the bed, does not appear as yellow dot on the minimap).\n\nTalk to him, and he will deny any connection to [[Zogre]]s. When you raise allegations, Sithik will challenge you to prove he is guilty. \n\nSearch the drawers, the cupboard and the wardrobe in Sithiks room. You will find a [[Book of portraiture]], a [[Necromancy book]], [[papyrus]] and [[charcoal]], and a [[Book of 'h.a.m']]. Read all three books.\n\nUse the Book of Portraiture on Sithik. He will recommend trying portraiture for yourself. Draw a portrait of Sithik by using the papyrus on him. He will admire either the 'truth' or the 'honesty' of your completed portrait: \n\nIf he likes the '''<nowiki/>'truth'''' of the portrait, you will need to drop it and make a new one. You can grab another papyrus from the drawers. If he likes the '''<nowiki/>'honesty' '''of the portrait, keep it.\n\nThe two portraits won't appear the same in the inventory and the correct one, when examined, will read \"''A classic realist charcoal portrait of Sithik.\"''\n[[File:Zogre Flesh Eaters interrogating Sithik.png|thumb|220px|Sithik is turned into an ogre.]]\nTake the portrait and the [[Dragon inn tankard|tankard]] back to the bartender. The bartender will recognise Sithik as the wizard seen with [[Brentle]], and will sign the portrait as an affidavit. Go back to the Magic Guild and use the Necromancy book, the Book of 'h.a.m.', the tankard, and the signed portrait on [[Zavistic Rarve]]. This will be enough evidence for Rarve to give you a [[Strange potion]], which he will instruct you to use on Sithik.\n\nUse the potion on the [[cup of tea]] on top of Sithik's dresser. Go down the ladder and back up to Sithik and you will find that he has turned into an [[ogre]].\n\nTalk to Sithik, and he will confess. Obtain answers to all three questions in order to make [[Relicym's balm]] and [[brutal arrows]].\n\n===Making or buying Relicym's balm===\nAfter [[Sithik Ints]] has revealed the secret to making [[Relicym's balm]], having it on hand in the final fight will help tremendously. It is your choice to obtain this now; however, the quest can be done without it. The balm is also tradeable.\n\nRelicym's balm is made by using a [[Rogue's purse]] on a [[vial of water]] and then adding [[snake weed]]. Due to the time taken to get the ingredients (both are non-tradeable), some players may find it easier to purchase a Relicym's balm from the [[Grand Exchange]].\n\nIt is '''HIGHLY''' recommended to make one and give it to [[Uglug Nar]], who is near the area in the start of the quest. This will give access to a store selling 100 Relicym's balm (3), and he will give you enough money (650gp) to buy three of them back. The store also has 100 [[Achey logs]], 10 [[bow string]]s, 10 [[cooked chompy]], and five [[knives]] in stock.\n\n===Making brutal arrows===\n[[Brutal arrows]] are the best way to kill [[Zogre]]s, and shooting them from a [[composite ogre bow]] is the best strategy in the final fight. It is your choice to obtain them; however, the quest can be done without it. The easiest way to obtain them will be from the [[Grand Exchange]], as both the brutal arrows and the composite ogre bow are tradeable.\n\nTo make the composite ogre bow, use a knife on [[Achey tree logs]] with some [[wolf bones]] in the inventory. Use a [[bow string]] on the unstrung bow to complete the bow (requires 30 [[Fletching]]).\n\nTo make the arrows, use a knife on Achey tree logs and\u00a0fletch them into [[ogre arrow shaft]]s (each log will give 2-6 shafts). Add [[feathers]] to the shafts (each shaft needs 4 feathers). Finally, use [[nails]] (made of any [[metal]]) on the [[flighted ogre arrow]] while having a [[hammer]] in your inventory.\n\n===Relocating the ceremonial grounds===\n'''''Recommended: '''Food, armour (Ranged armour is preferred), [[Relicym's balm]], and a [[composite ogre bow]] and [[brutal arrows]]. [[Crumble Undead]] can also be used instead.''\n\nReturn to [[Grish]] and tell him what [[Sithik]] told you. Go through all available conversation options. After this he will give you a [[Ogre gate key|key]] which will give access to the ceremonial chamber to look for some 'old' items for him. However, you will end up finding a Zogre guarding the artifacts named [[Slash Bash]]. Slash Bash is weak to brutal arrows and the [[Crumble Undead]] spell. Other attacks, such as melee, are not effective as they will only hit up to 25% of the normal max hit. He also drains [[Prayer]] rapidly. Prepare accordingly, and don't forget to bring a Relicym's balm to remove [[disease]].\n\nReturn to the cave beyond the barricade and head west.

The boss can be safespotted, however you can still be attacked by his range attacks. Use the [[safe spot]] (pictured right) and kill the Zogre while having on [[Protect from Ranged]]. It is possible to use melee on the boss, however it will require using more resources and time since the damage is reduced against him.\n\nIt is possible to take too long to kill him, in which case he says something about growing weary of the fight and that he is awaiting a real challenge.

If your inventory is full the guard will make no mention of the miniquest and you '''will not receive the card'''. While doing the bar crawl, you'll be given a card with a list of all the bars you have to visit. Each one will be checked off when you've found it and drank the specific brew required. If you lose the card, you'll have to start the entire miniquest all over again.\n\nYou'll need to tell the barkeepers that you're doing the Alfred Grimhand Barcrawl and they will give you what you need. The brews are very strong, though, causing some damage as well as some steep temporary drops in stats. The entire trip will cost around 230 coins, plus money for [[runes]]/[[teleport tablet|tablets]] and boat trips to [[Karamja]]. Once you have every line of the card signed, return it to one of the guards at the Barbarian Outpost.\n\n===Visiting the bars===\nYou can visit the bars in any order.

With {{Skill clickpic|Firemaking|50}} and access to the [[Balloon transport system]], you could alternatively teleport to [[Castle Wars]] and pay [[Willow logs]] to get to the Lumber Yard.

Completing it will give players a [[Kourend favour certificate]], which gives players a head start by granting 20% [[favour]] in a House of the player's choosing.\n\nA player must speak with Hosa by the statue of King Rada I in Great Kourend to start the miniquest. [[Hosa]], the Hosidius architect, explains that he wishes to rebuild the statue of King Rada I in the centre of Great Kourend after it was heavily damaged in a storm. However, he is unable to receive the assistance of the other architects in their respective Houses, and requests that you do so for him.\n\nIn order to receive the assistance of a Great Kourend architect, players need to speak with them once they gain 100% favour in their respective House. Once players have spoken to an architect, they never lose the favour of the House in which they gained 100% favour. If a player achieves 100% favour with a house but forgets to speak with its architect and goes on to another house, their 100% favour is not locked in and it will decrease as favour in the next house increases. In order to complete the miniquest and rebuild the statue of King Rada, players must gain 100% favour in all Houses. \n\n'''Note: '''[[Hosa|Hosa's]] current verbiage is not as clear as the other architects when you speak to him once attaining 100% favour; regardless, favour will not be \"locked\" after speaking to him at 100%, you must speak to the specific Architect in the respectable House. His location does not change.\n\nThe location of the architects are as follows:\n<gallery>\nArcis location.png|[[Arcis]], the [[Arceuus House]] architect\nPiliar location.png|[[Piliar]], the [[Piscarilius House]] architect\nLovada location.png|[[Lovada]], the [[Lovakengj House]] architect\nShayda location.png|[[Shayda]], the [[Shayzien House]] architect\nHosa location.png|[[Hosa]], the [[Hosidius House]] architect\n</gallery>\n\n==Gaining favour==\nBefore beginning the miniquest, it is recommended that players complete the [[Client of Kourend]] [[quest]]. Completing it will give players a [[Kourend favour certificate]], which gives players a head start by granting 20% [[favour]] in a House of the player's choosing.\n\nThe player can gain favour in a House in any order. However, once 100% favour is gained in one House, be sure to speak to the respective House's architect before gaining favour in another House. This allows players who have gained 100% favour in a House to gain favour in another House without losing favour in the others. The mini quest has to be started in order to lock in favour.\n\nIf you have not completed any Kourend quest, nor gained any favour yet, the following order can be used to gain 100% favour in all houses within around 7 hours. Note that this may not be the fastest or most efficient order. You can read the full guides for further information.

The ghost is standing outside the tomb entrance.

He will then give you a [[Ghostly robe (top)]] and request you to find another ghost named [[Rennard]], along with a hint on how to find him. '''Pay attention to the hint given''', as it indicates the sequence necessary to complete the quest:\n\n*If he mentions ''pirates and a shipwreck'', '''Sequence 1''' must be followed for the entirety of the quest.\n*If he mentions the thief being ''northeast'' of there, '''Sequence 2''' must be followed for the entirety of the quest.\n*If he mentions the thief being ''southeast'' of there, '''Sequence 3''' must be followed for the entirety of the quest.\n\nOne must visit the ghosts in the correct order.

Once spoken to, he will give the [[Ghostly gloves]].\n#[[Kharrim]] can be found at the [[Chaos Temple (hut)]] altar in Level 38\u00a0[[Wilderness]] north of [[The Forgotten Cemetery]]. Once spoken to, he will give the [[Ghostly boots]].\n#[[Lennissa]] can be found at the church on [[Entrana]]. (Bring a [[Ghostspeak amulet]] if using [[Morytania legs 2]] or higher, as they are not allowed on the island).

Once spoken to, he will give the [[Ghostly cloak]].\n\n===Sequence 2===\n#[[Rennard]] can be found at the [[Bandit Camp (Wilderness)]] near the shops. If you are having trouble speaking to him without getting attacked by the [[Bandit (Wilderness)|bandits]], you can try to lure them into the nearby food store and shut the door. Once spoken to, he will give the [[Ghostly gloves]].\n#[[Kharrim]] can be found at the [[Graveyard of Shadows]] ([[Carrallangar Teleport|Carrallangar]]). It may take a while to get your conversation finished. because the [[zombie]]s and [[ghost]]s will be [[aggressive]] and will interrupt your conversation. He will give the [[Ghostly boots]].\n#[[Lennissa]] can be found at the [[Port Sarim]] docks at the [[Lady Lumbridge]].

Once spoken to, he will give the [[Ghostly hood]].\n#[[Viggora]] can be found in the [[Edgeville Dungeon]] near the [[earth warrior]]s in the northernmost room.

These are references to famous translation errors in the game [[Wikipedia:Zero Wing|Zero Wing]].\n*When speaking to [[Rennard]], your player says \"I ain't scared of no ghost,\" a reference to \"I ain't afraid of no ghost\" from the [[Wikipedia:Ghostbusters|Ghostbusters]] theme song.\n*If you are level 99 [[Magic]] while talking to [[Dhalak]], he will ask if you are the \"mighty sorcerer that binds him\". Your character will respond by bragging about said [[skill mastery]].\n*[[Morytania legs 2]] or higher acts as a ghostspeak amulet when worn; with a later update, these items now work during this miniquest. Note that you cannot take these to [[Entrana]].\n*When speaking to Valdez, he asks if you can perform one, small favour for him.

You will need to find treasure in the same manner as a game of hot and cold by \"feeling\" the key and reacting to its response.\n\nIn three of the sites, there will be the God [[mjolnir]]s, or God spears:\n* [[Saradomin mjolnir]] [[File:Saradomin mjolnir.png|Saradomin mjolnir]]\n* [[Guthix mjolnir]] [[File:Guthix mjolnir.png|Guthix mjolnir]]\n* [[Zamorak mjolnir]] [[File:Zamorak mjolnir.png|Zamorak mjolnir]]\n\nThis is the only way to obtain these unique weapons, other than trading with another player.\n\n===Temperature readings===\nThe Enchanted key changes temperature as the player moves about. Its temperature is based on the distance of the treasure from the player, measured in the number of steps (including diagonal steps) it would take to reach the treasure, ignoring any obstacles (this is the {{wp|Chebyshev distance}} between the player and treasure). The warmer the key gets, the closer the player is to the treasure. Clicking \"Feel Enchanted key\" gives information on its temperature, consisting of two parts described below. It is like playing the game of hot and cold.\n\n====First part====\nThe following table indicates the 8 possible temperature readings based on the distance to the treasure (measured as described above):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Distance\n!Temperature description\n|-\n|More than 1000 squares\n|'''It's freezing'''\n|-\n|701 to 1000 squares\n|'''It's very cold'''\n|-\n|401 to 700 squares\n|'''It's cold'''\n|-\n|101 to 400 squares\n|'''It's warm'''\n|-\n|61 to 100 squares\n|'''It's hot'''\n|-\n|31 to 60 squares\n|'''It's very hot'''\n|-\n|5 to 30 squares\n|'''Ouch! It's burning hot'''\n|-\n|Up to 4 squares\n|'''The key is steaming'''\n|}\n\nWhen a player receives the message \"'''The key is steaming'''\", he or she should use a [[spade]] to dig up the treasure. Note that, as indicated by the table, there is a 9 by 9 square region in which they may dig.\n\n====Second part====\nIf the player has already felt the key since last logging on or finding treasure, the temperature reading will contain a second part, indicating whether the temperature is warmer, colder or the same \nas the last reading, thereby indicating whether the distance to the treasure (measured as described above) has increased, decreased, or is the same. The three descriptions are:\n* '''Warmer than last time''' - You are getting closer than before.\n* '''Colder than last time''' - You are getting farther away than before.\n* '''Same temperature as last time''' - You are the same distance away.\nPlayers may use this information to determine which direction to go, as follows:\n# Move one square north, south, east and west, taking temperature readings between each step.\n# One direction, for example north, will result in the message \"'''Warmer than last time'''\".\n# Move directly north while constantly taking readings, until the message \"'''Same temperature as last time'''\" is produced.\n# Move one square east and west, taking temperature readings between each step.\n# One direction, say east, will result in the message \"'''Warmer than last time'''\".\n# At this point the treasure is directly north-east of the player.\n# Move diagonally in this direction while taking readings, until the message \"'''The key is steaming'''\" is produced.\n\n===Items===\n* Enchanted key - used to locate the buried chests.\n* [[Spade]] - used to dig the buried chests.\n* [[Teleport]] runes/jewellery - highly recommended; used to teleport to various chest locations (e.g. [[Dueling ring]]).\n* [[Boots of Lightness]] - recommended; to maintain [[energy]] levels.\n* [[Spottier cape|Spottier]] or [[Spotted cape]] - recommended; to maintain energy levels.\n* [[Penance gloves]] - recommended; to maintain energy levels.\n* [[Graceful outfit]] - recommended; to maintain energy levels.\n\n==Treasure locations==\nThere are a total of 11 treasure sites to be found.

The attack style of the weapon does not matter, as all will hit equally, though a slashing weapon can help take care of the slash-weak [[terror dog]]s that will attack you.\n*'''Ranged:''' There are no safe spots to hide in to avoid being hit. The room is large so it is possible to reduce incoming damage by positioning so that only one thing is attacking at a time. He shouldn't take too long to kill using a [[crystal bow]] or a [[black salamander]].\n*'''Magic:''' At least [[Wind Wave]] is recommended, with a level 60 or better weapon.\n*'''Food:''' The journey to [[Tarn]] is probably harder than the fight itself. There are many traps and skeletons between the last bank spot and Tarn. A full inventory of [[monkfish]] (or equivalent) or better should work for anyone doing this miniquest.\n*'''Potions: '''There are no special potions required for this fight however a [[super set]] or a [[combat potion]] would help. If you're planning on using prayer during the fight two to four [[prayer potion]]s would be required as prayer is constantly drained during the final battle.\n*'''Other:''' Some form of teleportation is recommended. After Tarn Razorlor is killed, four [[terror dog]]s will enter the room making it difficult to leave and the only way out is the route taken to get there.\n\n==Walkthrough==\n{{Main|Tarn's Lair}}\n\n[[File:Tarn's Lair.png|thumb|Follow this route to reach [[Tarn]], but beware of traps!]]\n\n===Starting off===\n[[File:Tarn's_Lair_Part_1.gif|thumb|left|The bank here costs 100 coins per use.]]\n'''The easiest way to get to [[Tarn]] is to teleport to [[Tarn's Lair]] via a [[slayer ring]].'''

Another simple alternative is to just carefully walk around them.\n|-\n|'''Wall trap'''\n|You will be hit 7-10 hitpoints\u00a0if you run past a wall trap\n|These are harder to see, but generally only occur in narrow passages, so check for them when you're in a narrow passage.\n|-\n|'''Log trap'''\n|You will be hit 15-20 hitpoints\u00a0by a log trap, and knocked to a level below.\n|Log traps only occur on jumps to pillars.

Following the more ornate doors (especially with water-features) will eventually lead you to Tarn Razorlor.\n|}\n\n# Starting at the [[bank]], go north through the doorway.\n# Follow the U-shaped hall heading westward to the end, and take the southwestern-most doorway.\n# You will now be in a trap-less, square room with a single giant [[skeleton]] in it. Go into the square room to the north, which has three floor traps in it, via the northern door, and take the passageway to the west.\n# You will now be in a hallway that looks like an inverted T. Take the passage to the '''NORTH''', and go through the opening on the west side. Don't go all the way west in the inverted T-shaped room, or you'll face more traps and monsters and end up going in a big circle. (There are no traps in the first part of the hall, but the north hall has two; the first one is on the west wall, and the second one is on the east wall.)\n# This puts you in room with a bunch of pillars that you must jump on. Make your way to the west side of the room using the southern pillars, and deactivate the log swing trap by searching the floor. Sometimes, the trap will not deactivate when you search it, thus you should click the floor again, and if the trap has been deactivated, texts will appear saying, \"That flagstone has already been pressed down. You'll need to wait until it reactivates.\" Then, it will be safe to cross. The log swing trap will reset in 10 to 15 seconds, so you must move quickly. Use the second row of pillars from the west to go north.\n# Follow the path to the east (with a wall trap on the south and then north walls), and you will end up in a room with a big hole in the centre. The walls will shoot out from time to time and knock you into the hole if you are standing there. Time your moves to avoid being knocked into the hole. Take the passageway on the east wall. (There's a total of four areas that will knock you to the lower area.)\n# This is another room of pillars you have to jump on to get across; it does a zigzag across the room from the northwest to the southeast. You will be attacked by two level-94 [[skeleton mage]]s as you are crossing this room. They will start attacking you when you reach the second pillar. It is recommended to turn on [[Protect from Magic]] prayer and ignore them. Hurry across, and go down the stairs. Once on the bottom floor, the passageway to the north leads to Tarn's chamber.\n\n===Preparations===\n[[File:Tarn transforms.gif|frame|Tarn looks angry...]]\n*Make sure you check your health, prayer (if you're going to use it) and have your equipment in order to start the fight, as once you enter there will be little time for any preparations. '''Note''': Wearing the salve amulet is not compulsory to start or end this fight.\n*At least 2 [[prayer potions]] and/or 15 pieces of food ([[monkfish]] or better) left is recommended prior to entering Tarn's room.\n\n===Strategies===\n*The fight itself is fairly easy with high level combat stats (60+).\n*He can attack with both melee and magic, but attacks solely with melee if approached. Since the [[terror dog]]s can only use melee, [[Protect from Melee]] is strongly recommended.\n*[[Tarn Razorlor]] is the only monster required to be killed, so ignoring the minions and turning off Auto Retaliate is recommended.\n*Prayer is drained constantly, regardless of the use of prayers. Make sure you keep an eye on it.\n*During the fight with Tarn Razorlor, you can maneuver the terror dogs behind Tarn allowing you to only be attacked by Tarn himself, therefore eliminating the terror dogs from the fight completely.\n\n===Fighting Tarn Razorlor===\n[[File:Fighting Tarn.png|thumb|Fighting mutant Tarn.]]Note: The fight is instanced! So don't take any items you're not willing to lose in case of death.\n*A cut scene of [[Tarn]] transforming into a green mutant with lashing tentacles and unleashing two level-110 [[terror dog]]s appears upon entering the room. After this cut scene, the fight will begin. [[Animated steel armour]] (level 53) will also attack if moved near them.\n*As soon as the cut scene ends, turn on [[Protect from Melee]] and attack Tarn, who is level 69 Combat.\n*After his first form is defeated, he will turn into a ghost, but this form is easier to defeat.\n*As soon as Tarn is defeated, the northern door will open up.\n*[[Tarn's diary]] is in this next room on a table.

(Fairy ring {{Fairycode|cjr}}) You have to find him as he cannot be seen on the minimap, and he wanders around a lot. His wander range seems to be within a triangle formed by the\u00a0[[Rellekka]]\u00a0house portal, the\u00a0[[Agility shortcut]]\u00a0to\u00a0[[Sinclair Mansion]]\u00a0and the\u00a0[[Swaying tree]]. He will not recognise you as the adventurer that killed him earlier, but he also will not trust you to set you on a task. To gain General Khazard's trust, go to the\u00a0[[Seers' Village]]\u00a0and talk to\u00a0[[Sin Seer]]. She can be found upstairs in the house south-west of the [[range|cooking range]]. Bribe her with 40 coins, and she will give you\u00a0[[Sin Seer's note|a note]]\u00a0as exchange for your troubles. Return to General Khazard, and talk to him again. He will want you to visit four of his scouts around the world to check up on the status.\n\n===The ghost scouts===\nYou will now need to find the four scouts. One is in Tai Bwo Wannai, another is outside Falador, the third one is in the Kharidian Desert and the last one is outside the Gnome Stronghold. Make sure you wear the\u00a0[[Ring of visibility]]\u00a0to see them, the\u00a0[[ghostspeak amulet]]\u00a0to talk to them, and the\u00a0[[Ghostly robes]]\u00a0for them to recognise you as a messenger for General Khazard. It should be noted that the Scouts will not appear as yellow dots on your minimap, so pay careful attention to your screen to avoid passing them.\n\nThe\u00a0[[Scout (Tai Bwo Wannai)|Karamjan scout]]\u00a0is near the\u00a0[[Tai Bwo Wannai]]\u00a0village. Go to the special tree grove with\u00a0[[mahogany tree|mahogany]]\u00a0and\u00a0[[teak tree]]s, and search just a bit to the south-east of there. Speak to him, he will tell you that the villagers recently left because of some curse caused by their gods, but they came back.\n\nThe\u00a0[[Scout (Tree Gnome Stronghold)|Gnomish scout]]\u00a0is to the south of the\u00a0[[Gnome Stronghold]]. He could be right by the entrance, but he may be anywhere from near the orchard, circling around the Apple orchard, and up to where the\u00a0[[Hobgoblin]]s\u00a0are camped. He will comment on Hazeel, The Plague, and Glough.\n\nThe\u00a0[[Scout (Falador)|Faladian scout]]\u00a0is a little east of\u00a0[[Falador]], between the Falador east wall and the\u00a0[[Draynor Manor]]\u00a0west fence. He will also not have anything useful to say, only that Count Draynor has been dispatched by an adventurer, but he will have to go inside to confirm this.\n\nThe\u00a0[[Scout (Shantay Pass)|Kharidian scout]]\u00a0is a little south of the\u00a0[[Shantay Pass]]. Go through the pass, and search the area around the rock formation just to the southwest of the pass. ('''Note:'''\u00a0You may want to bring\u00a0[[waterskin]]s\u00a0to survive the desert heat.) He will inform you that he followed someone called Lazim, and that Khazard may have two more players at the Ritual. He also comments on the prisoner of Jaldraocht having been freed, and that General Khazard used to live in the desert, although not by choice.\n\nWhen you are talking to the last of the four scouts, be sure not to end the conversation until you receive the message that you are to relay back to\u00a0[[General Khazard]]. The message is \"We of the Blood are still loyal. Pavlov is the messenger.\"\n\n===Bouncer returns!===\n'''Note:'''\u00a0During the fight, you\u00a0'''cannot\u00a0'''use prayers of any sort, so be sure to bring some food.\u00a0\n\nReturn to General Khazard again, who will be grateful, still not recognise you and give you a\u00a0[[severed leg]]. He will redirect you to your reward, which is in a cave north of\u00a0[[Ardougne]].\n\nMake your way to the\u00a0[[Goblin Cave]], right by the\u00a0[[Fishing Guild]]. The cave is known from the\u00a0[[Dwarf Cannon]]\u00a0and\u00a0[[One Small Favour]].\u00a0Enter the cave, and head north. Take the first passage to the east, and you will arrive at a larger cavern. Do whatever you need to prepare, and enter the \"crack\" in the south wall of the cavern.

Use your preferred method to kill it. If you are around a combat level of 100, supplies will most likely be unnecessary. The ghost of Bouncer can hit up to 20, but usually hits 12-18s, so make sure your hitpoints\u00a0do not drop too low. You cannot use prayer during the fight. Keep hitting the ghost until its health drops to 10 hitpoints. Then, you will automatically throw the severed leg to distract the ghost. Once it is distracted, you will say \"Away, darn spot!\" and deliver a final blow, killing it. If you are well armoured and have a good stabbing weapon, it is possible to defeat him without any food or potions, even if you have a relatively low combat level. You may also hide in the south-west corner, where the ghost cannot hit you, and use poison to weaken it while hiding. You can also lure Bouncer to the South-East corner to safe spot. \n\nYou will receive some Slayer experience and a new sword.\n\n'''Congratulations!! Miniquest complete!!'''\n\n==Rewards==\n* The\u00a0[[Shadow sword]]. This can be reclaimed from the\u00a0[[Ghost (NPC)|ghost]]\u00a0that will appear after Bouncer's defeat for free.\n* {{Skill clickpic|2 = 2,000|Skill = Slayer}}\u00a0[[Slayer]]\u00a0experience\n\n===Afterwards===\nSpeaking to the General again after completing the miniquest will result in further dialogue. You will tell General Khazard, \"Your dog attacked me. AGAIN!\" General Khazard simply replies, \"He was angry that you killed him. Quite natural really. Now get out of here you filthy skinbag. I will not waste my time on you.\"\n\n==Trivia==\n* When Khazard hands you the severed leg, your player says: \"Ugh, well, at least it's not another hand.\" Then the General replies: \"What, have you dealt with severed limbs before?\" and the player replies: \"It's a long story.\" This is a reference to [[The Hand in the Sand]]\u00a0quest.\n* The final ghost you inform gives you a message to give to Khazard and adds on the statement: \"The messenger is Pavlov,\" probably referring to\u00a0[[Wikipedia:Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s dogs and Khazard's dog\u00a0[[Bouncer]].\n* When throwing the severed leg in the final battle, you automatically say \"Away, darn spot!\" Besides being a play on the famous dog name \"Spot\", this is a reference to the classic line from Shakespeare's play\u00a0[[Wikipedia:Macbeth|''Macbeth'']]\u00a0wherein Lady Macbeth utters the phrase \"Out, damned spot!\" when she is sleepwalking, and feeling guilty for helping to murder the Scottish king. However, she is referring to an imaginary stain of blood, not cursing a dog.\n* The scouts will make references to quests that players have completed in their area. For example, if the player has completed the\u00a0[[Vampire Slayer]]\u00a0quest then the Falador scout will talk about an adventurer killing [[Count Draynor]] and how he will have to verify whether this is true or not.\n* The scouts are not human, as they repeatedly disaparage humans during their conversations with the player. Their actual race is unknown.\n\n{{Miniquests}}"], "The Mage Arena": ["{{otheruses|the [[miniquest]]|the Arena itself|Mage Arena}}\n{{Quest details\n|start = Talk to\u00a0[[Kolodion]]\u00a0at the\u00a0[[Mage Arena]] bank\u00a0located in level 53\u00a0[[Wilderness]].\n|difficulty = N/A\n|length = Short\n|requirements = 60 {{Skill clickpic|Magic}} [[Magic]]\n|items = Runes to fight [[Kolodion]] with\n|kills = [[Black Demon]] (level 112)\n}}\n\nBeware: caution must be taken not only getting to the arena but also during the miniquest. PKers are able to attack you while you are doing the minigame fight\n\nPlayers with level 60 or higher [[Magic]] can begin The Mage Arena. Head out into level 56 [[Wilderness]] to start, but watch out for [[Player killing|player-killers]]. The quickest way to get there is by use of the levers in the ruins of [[Edgeville]] and in the small building near the gate to [[West Ardougne]]. Pulling either of these levers will teleport you to the [[Deserted Keep]], a small island surrounded by lava in level 54 Wilderness. From there, run north, slash a web with a [[knife]], [[sword]], or other sharp object, and then proceed west a short distance to the Mage Arena bank, which also requires players to slash webs to access.\n\n==Walkthrough==\n===Getting there===\nNorth-west of the actual Mage Arena is a little broken down house. Use a [[knife]] or a [[weapon]] which has the '[[slash]]' [[attack style]] to cut down the webs in the house. Once the two webs have been cut, pull the lever on the wall of the house to be teleported into a small cave. While you are in here, you are completely safe from [[PKers]]. In here, is a [[Lundail's Arena-side Rune Shop|rune store]], a [[bank]], and [[Kolodion]], the [[non-player character]] who must be talked to in order to start the Mage Arena minigame. Kolodion will also be fought during the minigame, so just talk to him to begin. After a long dialogue, you will end up fighting him.\n\n===Battling Kolodion===\n[[File:Fighting_Kolodion.png|thumb|left|A player engages in combat with Kolodion.]]\n[[Kolodion]] changes form as the fight progresses. At the start, he appears in the form you see him when you speak to him. He can only be damaged using [[Magic]]. After defeating this form, he transforms into an [[ogre]]-type creature. Despite being in [[Melee]] range, this form and all forms afterwards are magic-based, so the\u00a0[[Protect from Magic]]\u00a0[[prayer]] will make you invulnerable to his attacks.\u00a0The next form is a giant [[Ice spider|frost spider]], then a [[ghost]], then finally a level 112 [[black demon]].\n\nFor all of these battles, it is recommended to use the strongest [[spell]] you have the level for. As each form changes, the [[Hitpoints]] of the form increases. With Prayer and decent [[food]], the battles are fairly easy to win. At level 70+ Magic using [[Ahrim's armour set]], around only 100 casts of the [[Wave spells]] are needed to defeat all five of Kolodions forms. [[Iban Blast]] is also a viable option as its power allows for Kolodion's defeat in as little as 50 casts, even at level 60 Magic wearing only [[Mystic robes]].\n\nYou can exit the fight at any time by running out of the arena and pulling the lever to the north. Kolodion will be in the form you left off at when you return.\n\n== Reward ==\nOnce Kolodion is defeated, the minigame ends and players will be teleported out of the arena, and Kolodion will congratulate them on a fight well fought. He will then ask players to choose their [[Gods#Major Gods|God]]. To do this, head into the nearby 'Sparkling pool' and you will come out near a staff merchant. Head past him into the room with the three god statues. Now, choose your god and pray at the relevant statue. Players will then receive one of the [[God capes]], determined by which god is prayed to. After receiving the cape, head back and speak to the merchant to receive one of the [[God staves]];\u00a0which will be the partner to the cape. To unlock the god spells and use them outside of the arena, they must be cast 100 times inside the arena. '''It may be prudent to only attack the Guthix and Zamorak-aligned [[Battle mage|battlemages]], as some player killers will dress up as a Saradomin mage and hop worlds in order to [[Skull (status)|skull-trick]] players into losing all of their items. Also note, due to having to cast the spells manually, hiding the attack option won't prevent getting tricked.''' To obtain other god staves to cast other god spells outside the arena, talk to the merchant who will charge 80,000 [[coins]] as a fee for the staff and then cast the other spell 100 times in the arena. God staves cannot be wielded with the cape of another god, for example, the [[Saradomin cape]] may not be worn while wielding a [[Guthix staff]]. The capes are required to cast the [[Charge]] spell at level 80+ Magic, and can be changed by praying at the desired god's statue.\n\nThe staves are shown below.\n\n[[File:Saradomin staff.png|Saradomin staff]][[File:Guthix staff.png|Guthix staff]][[File:Zamorak staff.png|Zamorak staff]]\n\n{{Miniquests}}"], "The Mage Arena II": ["{{otheruses|the [[miniquest]]|the Arena itself|Mage Arena}}\n<choose>\n<option>[[File:Imbued saradomin cape detail.png|150px|right]]</option>\n<option>[[File:Imbued zamorak cape detail.png|150px|right]]</option>\n<option>[[File:Imbued guthix cape detail.png|150px|right]]</option>\n</choose>\n'''The Mage Arena II''' is the sequel to [[The Mage Arena]] [[miniquests|miniquest]]. Players with level 75 [[Magic]] and the ability to cast [[Saradomin Strike]], [[Flames of Zamorak]], and [[Claws of Guthix]] outside the [[Mage Arena]] can start this [[miniquest]] by talking to [[Kolodion]] in the [[Mage Arena]] bank.\n\nHere, players must defeat three powerful god followers roaming the Wilderness; [[Porazdir]], [[Justiciar Zachariah]] and [[Derwen]] and collect their remains in order to enhance their [[god capes|god cape]].\n\n==Details==\n{{Quest details\n|start = Talk to\u00a0[[Kolodion]]\u00a0at the\u00a0[[Mage Arena]] bank\u00a0located in level 53\u00a0[[Wilderness]].\n|difficulty = N/A\n|length = Short\n|requirements = *Completion of [[The Mage Arena]]\n*{{Skill clickpic|Magic|75}} [[Magic]]\n\n*Casted [[Claws of Guthix]], [[Flames of Zamorak]], and [[Saradomin Strike]] each 100 times inside the Mage Arena.\n|kills = [[Porazdir]] (level 235), [[Justiciar Zachariah]] (level 348), and [[Derwen]] (level 235)\n|items = Runes to cast god spells}}\n\n==Walkthrough==\n===Starting out===\n[[File:Kolodion chathead.png|left]]\nHead to the broken down house north-west of the [[Mage Arena]] in level 55 [[Wilderness]]. Use a knife or slash weapon to cut down the two webs in the house. Once the webs have been cut, pull the lever on the wall to be teleported into a small cave. The cave is a '''safe zone'''; you cannot be attacked by other players inside here.\n\nSpeak to [[Kolodion]] about additional challenges. He will tell you that he has been working on a spell that will increase the powers given by your [[god cape]], but the components he requires are difficult for him to obtain. As the spell imbues the power of the three gods [[Saradomin]], [[Zamorak]], and [[Guthix]], he requires the components of three powerful opponents who are each aligned to a god. You will then receive the [[enchanted symbol]]. This acts similar to the [[enchanted key]] and [[strange device]].\n\n===Tracking===\n[[File:Enchanted symbol detail.png|left]]\nBefore tracking down the followers, it is '''highly recommended''' to set the Player 'Attack' option to \"Always right-click\" or \"Hidden\" in the ''Controls'' panel in the [[Options]] interface, so you do not accidentally become [[skulled]].\n\n[[File:The Mage Arena II - boss spawns.png|thumb|right|250px|A map displaying the general locations in which the followers will spawn.]]\nAfter you have received the [[enchanted symbol]], you can look for the three god followers located within the deep [[Wilderness]], around [[Lava Dragon Isle]]. Most if not all areas will be in multi-combat zones, so stay cautious! Each use of the symbol can deal up to 16 damage, and can kill the player.\n\nThe symbol functions similarly to the [[Treasure Trails/Guide/Hot Cold|Hot & Cold]] from Master treasure trails; as the player gets closer to where the follower is residing, the symbol will glow hotter, and the further you are, the colder it gets.\n\nWhen the symbol states that it is visibly shaking, the follower will appear and attack you. Since you may run out of food most of the time searching for the followers, try to pinpoint their exact location before returning to a bank to restock on food.\n\nThe follower's spawn locations are random, and will change occasionally; you will be notified of this when you use the enchanted symbol after the spawn change.\n\nIf a follower has already spawned in the location where yours is supposed to spawn, you must either [[World switching|hop worlds]] or wait for it to despawn and use the enchanted symbol again.\n\n===Battling the followers===\nThe followers are very powerful monsters, being able to hit up to 43 if not using [[Protect from Magic]], and can cast [[Ice Barrage]] and [[Tele Block]]. It is possible to dodge the [[Ice Barrage]] attack by stepping off the square you were standing on when the spell was cast. Unlike other players' Tele Block, this only lasts for a minute if [[Protect from Magic]] is used, rather than two and a half minutes. \n\nIn addition, the followers can only be harmed by their respective god spells, so you must use all three god staves for each of the three followers. Alternatively, using the [[staff of the dead]] (or its [[Toxic staff of the dead|toxic variant]]), the [[staff of light]] or the [[Void knight mace]] to autocast [[Flames of Zamorak]], [[Saradomin Strike]] and [[Claws of Guthix]], respectively, is recommended, as their magic attack bonuses are higher, in addition to making the fight slightly easier by allowing the player to autocast god spells.\n\nEach follower also has their own unique ability, making the fight slightly more challenging:\n\n*[[Porazdir]] can launch an energy ball at the player. The amount of damage it deals is dependent on your distance to him. The further you are, the less damage it deals. If you are extremely far away, it will deal no damage.\n*[[Justiciar Zachariah]] will occasionally swing his sword, resulting in a blue wave aimed at the player's current tile when it was used. If not avoided, players will be dragged next to him, where he will start attacking them with melee. Simply move one tile elsewhere from its target tile to avoid the attack.\n*[[Derwen]] can launch energy balls on the ground. They heal him for 5 health every few seconds, and must be destroyed to stop him from healing. Each ball has 20 health.\n<gallery>\nFighting Porazdir.png|A player fighting Porazdir, one of Zamorak\u2019s most trusted generals.\nFighting Justiciar Zachariah.png|A player fighting Zachariah, one of the last remaining justiciars of Saradomin.\nFighting Derwen.png|A player fighting Derwen, an ancient servant of Guthix.\n</gallery>\n\nYour inventory should consist of:\n*1 [[Stamina potion]]\n*6 [[Saradomin brew]]s\n*2 [[super restore]]s\n*13 pieces of food ([[sharks]] or better recommended)\n*[[Enchanted symbol]]\n*A [[slash weapon]] ([[Wilderness sword]]s recommended)\n*50+ casts of the appropriate [[god spell]]\n*[[Ring of recoil]] (with one already equipped)\n\nEven with [[Protect from Magic]], they will still hit hard and accurately, up to 20+. Thus, it is recommended to wear a [[mystic robe top]] and [[mystic robe bottom|bottom]], along with easily replaceable items, such as the [[Culinaromancer's gloves]], the [[book of darkness]], and a [[god cape]] (''note that the cape's god alignment must be the same as the god spell you're casting''). If you have at least level 80 [[Magic]], bring additional runes for [[Charge]], as it will increase the max hit of your god spells from 20 to 30.\n\nIf players are assigned a [[black demon]] for their [[Slayer assignment]], wearing a [[slayer helmet (i)]] is recommended when fighting [[Porazdir]], as the player's attacks would be more accurate.\n\nBecause of the high damage dealt by them, taking at least two rings of recoil gives 80 free damage over the course of the fight, which can be very helpful.\n\nIf the followers are not slain quick enough, they will despawn, and you will have to track it again and restart the fight.\n\n===Finishing up===\n<choose>\n<option>[[File:Demon's heart detail.png|left|140px]]</option>\n<option>[[File:Justiciar's hand detail.png|left|140px]]</option>\n<option>[[File:Ent's roots detail.png|left|140px]]</option>\n</choose>\nUpon killing Justiciar Zachariah, Porazdir and Derwen, they'll drop a [[Justiciar's hand]], [[demon's heart]] and [[ent roots]], respectively. Once you obtain one, run back to Kolodion so that he can hold it for safekeeping. If your supplies are low, it's best to teleport back to a safe location and restock on food and potions before giving the component to Kolodion. If you're killed and it isn't one of your protected items, you'll have to kill the follower again.\n\nAfter collecting all three components, return them to Kolodion within the Mage Bank to complete the miniquest. After you have done so, you will be able to hand a cape to Kolodion which he will then imbue. To acquire another imbued cape, the player must find the corresponding follower to the cape that they wish to upgrade, kill it again for another drop and take it back to Kolodion. This means a total of five followers must be defeated in order to obtain all three imbued god capes.\n\nThe cape, like most untradeable equipment, is automatically protected upon death in dangerous PvM scenarios outside of the Wilderness. However, should a player die to another player in the Wilderness, the player '''will''' lose the cape, and the killer will receive 60,000 [[coins]] as loot.\n\n==Controversy==\nOn release, players instead had to kill three god-aligned demons, the [[Demon of Darkness]], [[Demon of Light|Light]] and [[Demon of Balance|Balance]], and claim their hearts to finish the miniquest. However, the miniquest was criticised by players as being rushed and of lower quality than was to be expected from the Old School Team, for several reasons:\n[[File:The Mage Arena II - old demon boss.png|thumb|270px|A player fighting the now-removed [[Demon of Light]] with a [[twisted bow]].]]\n*The three bosses were simply three demons recoloured from Kolodion's final form, and all of them had the same set of attacks, save for the god spells they used.\n*The bosses had moderately high offence and defence in magic, making even the use of [[Charge]]d god spells difficult to take them down.\n*Despite the [[Update:Dev Blog: Wilderness Rejuvenation II|original Developer's Blog]] stating that only god spells will harm the demons, the [[twisted bow]] was made an exception, causing the fights to be made much easier due to its [[passive effect]], with players accusing Jagex of going against what was polled.\n*The Demon of Light and Balance contradicted established lore, since demons were followers of Zamorak and were abhorred by Saradominist and Guthixian followers.\n\nAmidst these complaints, Jagex released [[Update:In Retrospect: Wilderness Rejuvenation II & W345|a newspost]] on 20 December stating that they are aware that the content was not up to the player's standards, with the post addressing the issues listed above, among other related content, with an expected rework of the miniquest coming in early 2018.\n\nThe miniquest was overhauled with [[Update:PvM QoL updates & Wilderness Rejuvenation improvements|an update]] on 8 February [[2018]], addressing all the issues listed above:\n*The demons were replaced by [[Porazdir]], [[Justiciar Zachariah]] and [[Derwen]], whose appearances are unique and thematically appropriate to their alignment to [[Zamorak]], [[Saradomin]] and [[Guthix]], respectively.\n**Each boss, while having a set of attacks shared between them, has their own unique special attack.\n**Despite their magic offence being almost twice as powerful compared to the original demons, their magic defence was significantly lowered to make up for it.\n*Additional dialogue was added to Kolodion to expand the lore of the new bosses.\n*The effectiveness of the twisted bow against the bosses was reduced.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Upon release, the quest journal stated prior to starting the miniquest \"I must be able to defeat multiple level 257 demons\", even though only one boss is a demon and is actually level 235. This was corrected in [[Update:Tournament Worlds: Theatre of Blood rewards|an update]] on 8 March 2018.\n*Upon release, once players had imbued their first god cape, they could imbue another cape without needing another demon's heart. In addition, casting [[High Level Alchemy]] resulted in receiving 60,000 coins. This was quickly hotfixed, with capes being obtained via this glitch and the ability to alchemize it removed.\n*It is not known whether the ability to dodge the [[Ice Barrage]] attack was intended or whether this is a bug.\n\n{{The Mage Arena II}}\n{{Miniquests}}\n[[Category:Old School-exclusive content]]\n[[Category:Jagex controversies]]"], "Recipe for Disaster/Another Cook's Quest": ["{{Infobox Quest\n|name = Another Cook's Quest\n|number = \n|image = [[File:Recipe for Disaster.png|300px]]\n|members = Yes\n|release = 15 March [[2006]]\n|update = Hundredth Quest - Recipe for Disaster!\n|series = None\n|difficulty = Special\n|developer = James B (framework)\n}}\n<onlyinclude>\n<includeonly>==</includeonly>==Details==<includeonly>==</includeonly>\n{{Quest details\n|start = The [[Cook (Lumbridge)|Cook]] in [[Lumbridge Castle]]'s kitchen.\n|difficulty = Special\n|description = The cook in Lumbridge has a surprisingly small number of ingredients to hand in his kitchen, possibly as a result of an endless stream of newcomers with light fingers taking anything that isn't nailed down from his kitchen.\n\nLuckily, in the past a kind [[Cook's Assistant]] was willing to help him in his culinary duties, but now a problem has appeared that could spell... a Recipe For Disaster!\n\nAlmost all members may attempt to solve his tricky predicament, and be rewarded accordingly, but only the very elite of Questers will be able to put an end to his problem permanently! \n|length = Short\n|requirements = *{{Skill clickpic|Cooking|10}} [[Cooking]]\n*Completion of [[Cook's Assistant]]\n|items = *An [[eye of newt]]\n*A [[greenman's ale]]\n*A [[rotten tomato]]\n*Any [[fruit blast]] excluding a [[premade fr' blast]]\n*[[Ashes]]\n}}\n\n<includeonly>==</includeonly>==Walkthrough==<includeonly>==</includeonly>\n<includeonly>==</includeonly>===The cook===<includeonly>==</includeonly>\n'''''Items required:''' An [[eye of newt]], a [[greenman's ale]], a [[rotten tomato]], [[ashes]], and a [[fruit blast]] (or 8 gold and a knife).''\n[[File:Cook (Lumbridge) chathead.png|left]]\nThe [[Cook (Lumbridge)|Cook]] will tell you that he needs a [[Eye of newt|newt's eye]], a [[Greenman's ale]], a [[rotten tomato]], and a [[dirty blast]] in order to prepare for the centennial feast.

You need [[ice gloves]] to wield a weapon. He's harder to defeat without [[prayer]], but you should be able to kill him with plenty of food. If you're [[Magic|maging]], be sure to use [[Water spells]]. If you're [[Ranged|ranging]], use [[ice arrows]]. You can [[snare]] him, run away, and then mage him so you only use little to no food. He drops [[cake]]s.\n\nIf you melee him without ice gloves, you will DROP your weapon.  Because the area is instanced, if you leave the battle without picking your weapon up, it will be lost.\n\n<includeonly>==</includeonly>===Karamel===<includeonly>==</includeonly>\nThis is [[Kamil]] from the [[Desert Treasure]] quest. Fight [[Karamel|her]] up close with a [[Fire spell]] that you're well above the required level to do. Bring [[stat restore potion]]s (she lowers your stats) and lots of food, even with lowering your stats, Karamel is incredibly accurate. A good strategy is to use [[Fire Bolt]] with [[Chaos gauntlets]]. As per usual, [[Melee]] doesn't work on her very well. However, unlike in Desert Treasure, her melee attacks don't do much damage. Since her melee attacks are not very strong, a good tactic is to stand right next to her so she hits you with Melee, which reduces how frequently she uses her ice attacks. Manually casting spells is beneficial due to her freezing effects stopping your auto-attacks. She drops a [[choc-ice]].\n\n<includeonly>==</includeonly>===Dessourt===<includeonly>==</includeonly>\nThis is [[Dessous]] from [[Desert Treasure]]. [[Melee]] doesn't work very well on [[Dessourt|him]], but wind [[Magic]] does. [[Ranged]] also works really well on him. Bring lots of food, and then, defeat him as quickly as possible. He drops [[chocolate dust]].\n\n<includeonly>==</includeonly>===Gelatinnoth Mother===<includeonly>==</includeonly>\nThis is the [[Dagannoth Mother]] from the [[Horror from the Deep]] quest, with that in mind you will need to bring Water, Air, Earth and Fire runes in order to attack her during her weakness. [[Gelatinnoth Mother|She]] can hit over 20 with [[Melee]], but she uses [[Ranged]] from a distance, which is usually incredibly inaccurate and hits 0's if you're wearing dragon (but can still hit up to 40 beware). She changes colour depending on her weakness. She has a low [[Magic]] [[Defence]], but high Melee and Ranged Defence. It is best not to bother with Melee or Ranged and just to focus on maging. A great strategy is to mage her while wearing [[rune armour]] or above. Otherwise, she will rip through [[Mystic robes]] and other magic robes with her ranged attacks. Your spells will still hit because of her low Magic Defence. She is level 130.\n\n<includeonly>==</includeonly>===Culinaromancer===<includeonly>==</includeonly>\nAfter you've defeated the [[Gelatinnoth Mother]], the [[Culinaromancer]] himself will attack you.

When your cat catches 7 hellrats it will become a [http://oldschoolrunescape.wikia.com/wiki/Hellcat hellcat].\n\nUsing these spices, you must construct the perfect stew for Evil Dave, which will be a stew that contains all four of the spices, but at different random values between 1-3. This can be a very time consuming process, so to conserve spices and save a lot of time with this, focus on finding out one spice potency at a time. \n\nStart off by using (1) dose of one colour on a stew and give it to Evil Dave. He will then eat and comment on your stew, there are two outcomes from this:\n\n'''''Correct: '''''If he says, ''\"one of the spices is correct, the rest are incorrect\"'' that means the current number you used is correct.

The easiest way is to use fairy ring code {{Fairycode|clr}}; however, this requires already having a [[Ninja monkey greegree|ninja greegree]] to escape the [[Ape Atoll Agility Course|agility course]]. If you do not already have a ninja greegree, you can get to Ape Atoll by going to the {{FloorNumber|2}} of the [[Grand Tree]] and speaking to [[Daero]].\n\n'''Recommended items''' throughout the stay at Ape Atoll: [[M'speak amulet]], [[Karamjan monkey greegree]] (or other greegrees), [[antipoison]] and [[food]].\n\n<includeonly>==</includeonly>===Greegrees===<includeonly>==</includeonly>\n'''''Items needed:''' 3,000 [[coins]] or 3 [[monkey talisman]]s. ''\n\n'''''Recommended:''' Combat equipment to kill a [[ninja monkey]] and a [[zombie monkey]], Ranged or Magic equipment to kill a [[monkey guard]], Prayer potion and food for combat and running through Ape Atoll dungeon. A stamina potion is highly recommended to massively reduce the amount of time spent running through the very long dungeon.''\n\nIn order to make the three required greegrees, you must bring a [[monkey talisman]] and the respective bones to [[Zooknock]] (located at the end of the [[Ape Atoll Dungeon]]). Monkey talismans can be purchased from the rune salesman on ape atoll for 1,000 coins each.\n\nOnce you land on Ape Atoll, head north with a greegree equipped (use the [[Karamjan monkey greegree|karamjan greegree]] if you do not have the others) and pass through the gate. Purchase three monkey talismans from the rune salesman. Next, kill a [[monkey guard]] and take its bones. Monkey guards are located near the prayer altar on Ape Atoll. Make sure to use Ranged or Magic and [[safespot]] them, as the monkey guards will infinitely recover health within melee range. A safespot location is in the north-east corner of the building behind the fire.\n\nNext you will need to kill a [[Ninja monkey]]. North of the bank icon on the mini-map are two ninja monkeys (monkey archers); either protect from range or safespot (by standing in the tall grass) to kill one. Make sure to grab the bones.\n\n[[Zombie monkey]]s can be found in the Ape Atoll dungeon (entrance located on the south side of the island). This is the same cave that [[Zooknock]] can be found in. Be wary of traps and poisonous spiders. \n\nEquip any greegree you have already, so that the monsters in the dungeon to Zooknook do not attack you. Negating the need for prayer potions. \n\nRubble will constantly fall on you throughout the cave dealing small amounts of damage. It is a good idea to bring [[antipoison potion]]s and [[food]]. Kill a zombie monkey in the cave and collect its bones. \n\nSpeak with Zooknock at the end of the cave with all three bones and talismans. Confirm that you want to make another greegree and then '''use''' the bones and talisman on Zooknock (he will pause after the conversation before giving you the greegree). Repeat this three times with the different bones to get all three greegrees.\n\n<includeonly>==</includeonly>===Awowogei's Palace===<includeonly>==</includeonly>\nBuy [[monkey nuts]] and grab a normal [[banana]] if you have not already. Make sure you've equipped one of your [[greegree]]s and your [[m'speak amulet]]. Go to [[Awowogei]]'s palace on [[Ape Atoll]]. Talk to Awowogei about his favorite food; he will refuse to divulge it, but will mention [[three wise monkeys|three monkeys]] in the temple.\n\nThe three monkeys are located in the temple north of Awowogei, in the north-west corner. Tell them that you're planning a surprise party for the king. They will tell you to stuff the [[snake corpse|corpse]] of a [[big snake]] with [[Sliced banana|banana slices]] and monkey nut paste. If you have a banana and the monkey nuts with you, speak to them again, twice, one for banana and one for monkey nuts. They will tell you that these are not good enough for the king's sophisticated palate, and that you will need to replace the ingredients with the sacred [[red banana]] and the [[tchiki monkey nuts]]. The normal [[banana]] and [[monkey nuts]] are no longer needed after this point.\n\n'''Note:''' If you speak with the three monkeys with a red banana in your inventory, they will eat it and you will need to get another. Be sure to '''<u>speak with all 3 monkeys</u>''' or the red banana tree will not spawn.\n\n'''Note:''' If your cooking level is at or just above the requirement (or you are boosting) the failure rate for cooking the [[stuffed snake]] is quite high. It is useful to obtain multiple [[tchiki monkey nuts]], [[Red banana|red bananas]] and [[Snake corpse|snake corpses]] (the [[drop trick]] may be used to obtain the nuts and bananas) to avoid having to re-gather the ingredients.\n\n<includeonly>==</includeonly>===Red banana===<includeonly>==</includeonly>\n[[File:Getting red banana.png|thumb|220px|Getting the banana.]]\nThe red banana tree is located on the north-west coast of the island, just south-west of the [[gnome glider]] icon. To get the [[red banana]], wield your [[gorilla greegree]], as you'll need lots of strength. Then, go to the west coast and find the tree. Use your [[rope]] on it to get the banana. Use the [[drop trick]] to get more bananas, since you might accidentally burn the snake.\n\nIf no bananas are on the tree, go to the three wise monkeys again with a normal banana and go through the dialogue regarding it until it is finished.\n\n<includeonly>==</includeonly>===Tchiki monkey nuts===<includeonly>==</includeonly>\n[[File:Picking tchiki bush.png|thumb|220px|Picking the tchiki nuts from the bush.]]\nWield your [[ninja greegree]], then go to the south part of town. The [[Ape Atoll Agility Course|Agility course]] start-point is on the other side of a small river. Once over the bridge, head south-west. You will need 48 [[Agility]] to access the course. Boosts will '''not''' work for this. Go across the obstacles until you find a broken hut around a hole in the ground. Go down and pick some [[tchiki monkey nuts]]. You might want to use the drop trick to get more nuts, since you might accidentally burn the snake. Players with access to [[fairy rings]] may use the code {{Fairycode|CLR}} to skip part of the Agility course.\n\nIf there are no nuts on the bush, return to the three monkeys and use the standard monkey nuts on one of them and go through the dialogue regarding it until it is finished.\n\nPets cannot be brought onto the Agility course.

Go east until you find a large hole in the ground, and enter the cave below.\n\n'''<span style=\"color:red\">Warning:</span>''' If you die in the cave, you will lose '''all''' your items and will '''not''' be able to recover them!\n\nYou will find five level 84 [[Big Snake]]s. Since they hit hard and are [[poisonous]], [[Protect from Melee]] is advised. Turn it on before entering the cave. Kill one and take the [[snake corpse]]. You might want to grab multiple corpses since you might accidentally burn the snake.

'''DO NOT''' use the [[red banana]] and [[tchiki nuts]] without slicing/grinding them, or it will result in a useless [[odd stuffed snake]]. Also, be careful not to eat them yourself.\n\nGo back to [[Ape Atoll]], equip a [[greegree]] (you will need your [[Zombie greegree]] soon, but cannot run with it equipped), and then go back to the temple. Go down the trapdoor protected by [[Monkey Guard|gorillas]], then down one of the ramps. There is a crack in the wall between the two bamboo ramps. Go through it, and you will see a patch of hot coals. This is where you need to equip your zombie greegree, as the hot coals will prevent you from going to the other side. Go to the long rock on the floor, boost your [[Cooking]] level if needed, and then, cook the snake on it. It is possible to [[Snake over-cooked|over-cook]] the [[stuffed snake]]. You will know if you successfully cook or burn the snake, as there will be an animation when you try to cook it.\n\nTravel back to [[Lumbridge Castle]]. '''Right click''' the stuffed snake, and use it on [[Awowogei]] (while having your [[m'speak amulet]] equipped). If you eat the snake, you'll have to get another one.\n\n'''Congratulations!

If you don't have any [[raw chompy|raw chompies]], kill a [[chompy bird]] or two and gather the raw chompies before you leave.[[File:Rfdarrowtree.png|thumb|220px|The location you need to make the fire.]]\nTravel to Karamja:\n* If you have used the [[fairy ring]] tele (Karamja is {{fairycode|ckr}}) then make your way west towards the coastline and then north up the coast until you find a tree with an arrow in it. \n* If you have travelled to Brimhaven, travel south past the general store and hug the west coastline. \nThe tree with the arrow in it is north-west of [[Tai Bwo Wannai]] village, just north of [[Banisoch]], who is marked with a dungeon icon - the tree is denoted by the [[Transportation]] icon.\n\nMake a fire next to the tree, and then, use your [[iron spit]] on a [[chompy]] and cook it. If you succeed, Rantz's kids will take the boat to you and take you back.\n\nRantz will tell you to make a balloon toad to use as bait, to catch the [[Jubbly bird]].\n\n*Fill your bellows up on the swamp\u2014then, use them on a toad. You should get around three toads just to be sure, because the next part can fail.\n*Mine the same amount of [[rock]]s as you have toads to the west of the swamp, near the Fairy Ring, to get a \"rock\". There is also a mining spot next to Rantz's cave. \n*With the rock and [[ball of wool]] in your inventory, inflate the bellows with swamp gas again; then, use them on your already inflated toad to create a [[balloon toad]].\n*''Drop'' the balloon toad south of Rantz's cave or east of the [[gnome glider]].\n[[File:Recipe for Disaster - Freeing Skrach Uglogwee - hunting jubbly.png|thumb|220px|The jubbly bird appears!]]\n*Now, wait for the [[Jubbly bird]] (level 9). If it doesn't appear, you'll get your wool back. If you've only gotten one balloon toad now you need to get another one. When it appears, kill it with your [[ogre bow]]. Then pluck it, take the meat, and '''''cook it on Rantz' ogre spit'''''. Go back to [[Lumbridge Castle]] and then '''''carefully right-click and use the cooked jubbly on Skrach Uglogwee.'''''
